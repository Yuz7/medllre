Glomus tumors (GTs) are small but extremely painful skin tumors of mesenchymal origin. GTs derive from the neuromyoarterial glomus in adults of middle-age and are generally benign. Due to their small size, diagnosis is often difficult and patients harboring these tumors usually consult many physicians, including sometimes neurosurgeons. More familiar to neurosurgeons are neoplasms as glomus jugular, glomus vagale, and glomus tympanicum that instead all belong to the family of paragangliomas (PGs) and for this reason should not be confused with the aforementioned skin tumors. Here we present a brief review of these two different classes of tumors and also the clarification of any misunderstanding that may derive from an improper use of the terminology. In order to illustrate why skin tumors may interest neurosurgeons, we have reviewed our institutional series of outpatient surgical procedures. Differential diagnosis with other tumors that appear as cutaneous nodules is also discussed. From January 2012 to May 2015, seven patients harboring a GT (six male and one female) were treated. The age ranged from 34 to 71&#xa0;Years (mean, 54.1). The clinical suspect of GT, was validated by ultrasound (US) and, if necessary, by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). All patients underwent surgery for total tumor removal. Immediate pain relief was obtained in all the patients, and no recurrences were observed during follow-up. Histology confirmed the diagnosis of GT. Subcutaneous painful nodules, originating from the glomus body, are properly called GTs. Unlikely from other tumors, as schwannomas or neurofibromas, GTs are the cause of pain that is disproportionate to their tiny size and that is not associated to neurological disturbances. Surgical treatment allows a complete regression of pain with significant patient satisfaction. Neoplasms originating from neuroepithelial cells, on the contrary, should not be defined as GTs.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"Glomus tumors (GTs) \", \"Symptoms\": [\"Local pain\"], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"Underwent surgery for total tumor removal\", \"CureRate\": \"1\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [\"Ultrasound (US)\", \"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\"], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

The patient was a 58-year-old woman who was referred to our hospital for a hepatic tumor detected by abdominal computed tomograpy (CT). On admission, she showed HBs antigen positive, mild anemia and liver dysfunction, and elevation of tumor markers. Abdominal CT demonstrated nodular tumors in segment 4. In addition, hepatic angiography additionally revealed multiple bilobar metastases. We treated this case with high-dose intraarterial adriamycin (150 mg/body) using HVI.CHP. There after, the patient received intermittent intraarterial low-dose epirubicin infusions (30 mg/body, 5 times) via an implantable catheter system. Furthermore, she was given a second high-dose of adriamycin (130 mg/body) under HVI.CHP 7 months after the first treatment. Despite repeated high-dose treatments, she had no severe side effects. The levels of tumor markers, including AFP and PIVKA-II, decreased to normal range, and all tumor nodules have disappeared in abdominal CT studies at present, 20 months after the initial treatment.

Clusters of axial and limb tonic contractions with head nodding began at 2 years of age. They occurred only during sleep, lasting 15 to 20 minutes and were pharmacoresistant. The child suffered slight mental delay. Interictal EEG showed left frontal spikes in slow sleep. Ictal video-EEG showed patterns of asymmetric spasms. MRI revealed a distinct white matter abnormality in the left frontal superior gyrus, corresponding clearly to localised cortical hypometabolism on FDG-PET and PET-MRI co-recording. SEEG investigation showed that the first spasm of the clusters corresponded to a localised discharge of rapid rhythms from the electrodes placed within the area identified as a lesion by MRI. Discharges then became more diffuse across the left frontal and temporal electrodes throughout the duration of the cluster. A tailored focal frontal resection was performed at 16 years of age. Spasms were very rare during the following three years (Engel class II).

During the first month of hospitalization, she mainly complained of a depressive mood and anxiety over the prognosis of her disorder, while she made scarcely any progress in introspection. In the second month, she gradually advanced with introspective work, but, as her introspection progressed, her depressive mood became aggravated. The therapist avoided intervention to modify her cognition, and told her the following: \"it is better not to persist in managing your depressive mood itself because curing depression does not mean resolving the superficial depressive mood, but to achieve a condition not directly influenced by mood.\" Then, at the beginning of the third month, she became aware of \"the presence of God\" and, at the same time, her depressive mood greatly improved. She extended her sympathy to her mother with her unfortunate life history, and expected her mother to change as she herself had experienced, but, disappointed by her mother, she experienced anxiety attacks and came to realize her own internal rage against significant persons in her life including her mother. After \"the Great being\" experience, she, who had formerly attended Christian church for a short time, started to read the Bible, but she still hesitated about committing herself to \"religious following.\" One day during the last month of hospitalization, as she prayed to God for healing when she read a part in the Bible about a woman suffering from a hemorrhage for twelve years who touched the hem of Jesus' garment and was healed immediately (Matthew 9:20-22 and Luke 8:43-48), the patient suddenly experienced \"the salvation of God\" and realized what trust really meant. Through the experience, her clinical problems became totally cured, and the therapy concluded with her discharge from hospital. Several months later, she sent the therapist a letter including the following message: \"I am grateful to the Lord for salvation from anxiety and irritation, but to the therapist for helping me realize it.\" This clinical course can be understood based on the patient's clinical problems (e.G., Despair, anxiety, and depression), arising from the breakdown of her efforts to maintain stability by founding her psychological base on her feelings of omnipotence, avoiding facing her internal negative psychological factors (e.G., Rage), and these were automatically resolved when her psychological base was switched to the transcendent level through \"the Great being\" experience and \"the salvation of God.\" Such a sudden, marked improvement resembles what Miller and C'de Baca reported as \"quantum change,\" of which the characteristics are vividness, surprise, benevolence, and permanence. The therapist paid attention to maintain a constant psychological distance from the patient, not persisting in modifying her cognition, with the transcendent level being the basis for the entire therapy. This stance of the therapist itself was considered to prompt her transcendence and bring about her eventual cure. This clinical course seemed to be highly suggestive of a psychotherapeutic mechanism, indicating the close relationship between the transcendent level and basic trust.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"Depression\", \"Symptoms\": [\"A depressive mood\", \"anxiety over the prognosis of her disorder\"], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"setting her psychological base on the transcendent level\", \"CureRate\": \"1\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

DT is attractive but supposes long-term continuation, which we aimed to evaluate. Retrospective study, in a center prioritizing 2nd TSS, of 36 patients, including 19 with TSS failure and 17 with recurrence, out of 119 patients with CD treated by a first TSS, average follow-up 6.1 Years (95% confidence interval 5.27-6.91). Control was defined as normalization of urinary free cortisol (UFC) and final treatment (FT) as the treatment allowing control at last follow-up. We also analyzed discontinuation rates of DT in published CD prospective clinical trials. Control was achieved in 33/36 patients (92%). DT was initiated in 29/36 patients (81%), allowing at least 1 normal UFC in 23/29 patients (79%) but was discontinued before last follow-up in 18/29 patients (62%). DT was FT in 11/29 patients (38%), all treated with cortisol synthesis inhibitors. Second TSS was FT in 8/16 (50%), BA in 14/14 (100%), and PR in 0/5. In published trials, discontinuation of DT was 11% to 51% at 1 year and 32% to 74% before 5 years. DT allowed at least 1 normal UFC in 23/29 patients (79%) but obtained long-term control in only 11/29 (38%), as discontinuation rate was high, although similar to published data. Interestingly, a successful 2nd TSS was the cause for discontinuing efficient and well-tolerated DT in 5 patients. Further studies will show whether different strategies with cortisol synthesis inhibitors may allow for a lower discontinuation rate in patients not candidates for a 2nd TSS so that BA may be avoided in these patients.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"Cushing's Disease \", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"Drug treatment (DT)\", \"CureRate\": \"0.38\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}, {\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"second TSS (2nd TSS)\", \"CureRate\": \"0.5\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}, {\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"bilateral adrenalectomy (BA)\", \"CureRate\": \"1\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}, {\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"pituitary radiotherapy (PR)\", \"CureRate\": \"0\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"Treated by a first TSS\"}]}"}]}

Orthotopic liver transplantation (LT) could offer a therapeutic option in monogenic diseases in two ways: by substituting for an injured liver or by supplying a tissue that can replace a mutant protein. In this respect, LT may be regarded as the correction of a disease at the level of the dysfunctional protein. Monogenic diseases that involve the liver represent a heterogeneous group of disorders. In conditions associated with predominant liver parenchymal damage (i.E., Genetic cholestatic disorders, Wilson's disease, hereditary hemochromatosis, tyrosinemia, &#x3b1;1 Antitrypsin deficiency), hepatic complications are the major source of morbidity and LT not only replaces a dysfunctional liver but also corrects the genetic defect and effectively cures the disease. A second group includes liver-based genetic disorders characterised by an architecturally near-normal liver (urea cycle disorders, Crigler-Najjar syndrome, familial amyloid polyneuropathy, primary hyperoxaluria type 1, atypical haemolytic uremic syndrome-1). In these defects, extrahepatic complications are the main source of morbidity and mortality while liver function is relatively preserved. Combined transplantation of other organs may be required, and other surgical techniques, such as domino and auxiliary liver transplantation, have been attempted. In a third group of monogenic diseases, the underlying genetic defect is expressed at a systemic level and liver involvement is just one of the clinical manifestations. In these conditions, LT might only be partially curative since the abnormal phenotype is maintained by extrahepatic synthesis of the toxic metabolites (i.E., Methylmalonic acidemia, propionic acidemia). This review focuses on principles of diagnosis, management and LT results in both paediatric and adult populations of selected liver-based monogenic diseases, which represent examples of different transplantation strategies, driven by the understanding of the expression of the underlying genetic defect.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"Monogenic diseases\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"Liver transplantation (LT)\", \"CureRate\": \"1\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"Single-gene mutations\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

The question whether embryonic, fetal, or adult stem cells offer particular advantages as the starting material remains to be resolved experimentally.

The first aim of the study was to evaluate the degree of xerostomia in 39 long-term survivors treated between 1965-1995 by conventional two-dimensional radiation therapy and currently without evidence of disease. The second aim was to develop a concise instrument to evaluate the subjective aspects of xerostomia. A newly developed questionnaire and a visual analog scale (VAS) were used in analyzing the degree of dry mouth and xerostomia-related problems. The radiation dose received by the major salivary glands was estimated by analyzing two-dimensional simulation films. Sixty-four percent of the patients experienced a moderate to severe degree of xerostomia. In the multivariate analysis, three questions regarding dry mouth, eating, and speech were particularly discriminatory for establishing the degree of xerostomia as expressed by the VAS score. In this survey, 64% of the long-term survivors, after treatment by conventional two-dimensional radiation therapy for a malignancy in the head and neck region, still experienced a moderate to severe degree of permanent xerostomia. A simplified instrument to evaluate xerostomia subjectively can consist of the VAS score and three graded questions.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"head and neck cancer\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"Radiation therapy\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [\"visual analog scale (VAS)\", \"analyzing two-dimensional simulation films\"], \"Causes\": \"After receiving radiation therapy for head and neck cancer \", \"MedicalHistory\": \"radiation therapy (RT) for cancer in the head and neck\"}]}"}]}

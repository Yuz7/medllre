He achieved a complete remission with the administration of AdVP (doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisolone), and thereafter received consolidation or intensification therapy 5 times in combination with AdVP plus enocitabine. A bone marrow examination carried out before the 6th round of chemotherapy revealed a slight increase of myeloblast (7%). L-AdVP (including l-asparaginase in addition to AdVP) was administered with a good result. However, 13 days after the end of the therapy he complained of acute abdominal pain, headache and fever. The following day, his consciousness level became lower and severe jaundice appeared. The serum transaminase level highly elevated with PT and aPTT severely elongated. He was diagnosed as having fulminant hepatitis. Elevation of the titer of IgM-HBc suggested that the fulminant hepatitis was attributed to HBV, which was probably transmitted by blood transfusion done in the first induction therapy and stayed latent during immunosuppressive chemotherapy. After receiving 10 sessions of plasma exchange (3.2 L/day), he recovered, free from any major complications except posttransfusion hepatitis. In his serum taken at 1 month after the recovery of posttransfusion hepatitis, HCV (Chiron) antibody was detected. There have been few reports concerning fulminant hepatitis associated with acute leukemia.

This scan showed unique uptake in liver segment VI, which was confirmed by MRI. CT levels reached to 253 ng/L when she finally accepted treatment.

Magnetic resonance lymphangiography showed dilated lymphatic vessels in the chest, whereas double-balloon enteroscopy (DBE) showed white villi and chyle leakage in the deeper part of the duodenal mucosa. A duodenal mucosa biopsy specimen revealed lymphangiectasia. She was diagnosed with protein-losing enteropathy (PLE). Treatment with a fat-restricted diet and tranexamic acid--previously reported to be effective against PLE--was attempted, but was ineffective. A thyroid tumor was simultaneously detected in her left neck, and was found to extend to the mediastinum on computed tomography. The tumor (size, >5 cm) was resected, and a pathological diagnosis of adenomatous goiter was made. The patient's serum albumin level increased to normal levels within 1 month postoperatively. After 6 months, (99m)Tc-HSA scintigraphy showed no albumin leakage from the gastrointestinal tract, and disappearance of white villi and chyle leakage on DBE.

The patient suffered from cold injury to the right foot 14 years ago, which was cold, painful, numb, and then the toe was ulcerated and gangrene. Only the right foot small toe was left. The right foot skin was swollen from the toe to the proximal segment 1 year ago, accompanied by resting pain. Both pain and autologous bone marrow stem cell transplantation were ineffective. The above symptoms were aggravated three months ago, and the pain was severe. The visual analogue score was 10 points. A high amputation of the left lower extremity was performed 30 years ago due to trauma. Physical examination: the bilateral femoral artery was weak, and the right radial artery, posterior tibial artery, and dorsal artery were not touched. Buerger sign (+). Auxiliary examination: angiography of both lower extremities showed complete occlusion of the bilateral external iliac artery and its distal end. The percutaneous oxygen partial pressure was measured to be 30 mmHg on the right side of the iliac crest. The operation was performed under the local anesthesia. After X-ray positioning, the body projection of the lumbar vertebrae 1-2 lamina gap was marked. The skin had a 1.8 Cm incision on the caudal side 2 cm from the mark. Then the dilators were used, and the working sleeve was tilted to the lumbar vertebrae 1-2 lamina gap.

The origin was expected to be near the left epicardial ventricular outflow tract (LVOT), which was termed the left ventricular summit area. Pace-mapping from the LVOT and the left coronary cusp (LCC) did not match well with the QRS morphology of the PVC. A good match was obtained from the distal great cardiac vein (GCV), and radiofrequency (RF) delivery eliminated the PVC and VT. However, the PVC recurred four times upon cessation of RF delivery. By placing an ablation catheter at the LCC, we obtained pace-mapping showing two different types of QRS morphologies; One was an rS pattern in V1, and the other was an R pattern in V1 with a longer stimulus to QRS interval, which was a nearly perfect match to the PVC. RF application to the LCC permanently eliminated PVCs and VTs. Several VTs from the epicardial LVOT can be cured by RF application from both the distal GCV and the LCC.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"Idiopathic ventricular tachycardia\", \"Symptoms\": [\"drug refractory ventricular tachycardia (VT)\"], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"Radiofrequency application from the distal great cardiac vein and the left coronary cusp\", \"CureRate\": \"1\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [\"Pace-mapping\"], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

By transduction of ovarian adenocarcinoma with the Herpes Simplex Thymidine Kinase gene and subsequent treatment with the antiviral agent ganciclovir, prolongation of survival has been described in nude mice. So far, however, in animal models of solid tumors no cures have been reported after gene therapy. In a prospective randomized experimental design 76 mice with xenotransplanted serous ovarian carcinoma were treated with three different doses of ADV/RSV-TK at three different time points followed by intraperitoneal ganciclovir administration. The experiment was designed to show significance of survival differences upon doubling of the number of survived days at a p-value of 0.05 With a power of 80%. The endpoint of the trial was survival. Treatment response was seen in all treated animals evident by significant prolongation of survival. Treatment response was dependent on the therapeutic viral dose and the tumor burden of the animal at the time of treatment. Two out of eight mice with early disease have now survived ten months without evidence of disease with untreated animals dying after nineteen days. Subcutaneous tumor development at the injection site was the reason of death in the remaining six mice of this group.

They are usually of traumatic origin but in rare cases may be congenital. When located in regions with difficult access, they constitute a difficult surgical problem because of intra-operative bleeding and significant morbidity. With the advent of transcatheter embolization and new embolic agents, embolization has become the treatment of choice, with a cure rate of over 95%, low morbidity and brief hospitalization. Occlusion of the fistula itself, rather than occlusion of feeding pedicles, is achieved by super-selective catheterization and the use of a suitable permanent embolic agent, depending on location of the fistula and its flow characteristics. A girl aged 2 10/12 with a large, high-flow, arteriovenous fistula of the internal maxillary artery is presented. Complete occlusion of the fistula itself, with full cure, was achieved by super-selective transcatheter embolization using Gianturco coils.

Supporting this prediction, I discuss that cancer might be controlled and even cured by combining three potential therapeutic strategies aimed at (i) cancer-specific targets, (ii) universally-vital targets with selective protection of normal cells (the selective combinations) and (iii) tissue-specific targets. Although (i) targeting cancer-specific pathways (e.G., By imatinib and gefitinib) is probable, it alone will not be sufficient to control cancer. This strategy is limited to oncogene (kinase)-dependent cancers and is further limited by therapy-induced resistance and tumor progression. Thus, targeting cancer-specific pathways needs to be complemented by two divergent therapeutic strategies: (ii) selective combinations and (iii) tissue-selective therapy. With selective protection of normal cells (based on cell cycle and apoptosis manipulation), combinations of selective and chemotherapeutic drugs can be effective in most common cancers. Alternatively, tissue-selective therapy can suppress cancer cells in a tissue-selective manner, sparing other tissues. While alone, each therapeutic strategy may cause drug resistance and even tumor progression; These obstacles can be overcome and even exploited by using all three strategies in sequence. And finally, these strategies will benefit from molecular diagnostics and can be used for chemoprevention.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"Cancer \", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"combining three potential therapeutic strategies\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

Most metastatic retinoblastoma cells express P-glycoprotein causing multidrug resistance (MDR). P-glycoprotein-rich blood vessels form blood-brain and blood-eye barriers, inhibit drug entry into central nervous system (CNS) and eyes. High-dose craniospinal radiation is too morbid for treatment of young children. To cure CSF metastasis without radiation, we designed an intensive multimodality chemotherapy regimen. After left eye enucleation, a 4-month-old boy with bilateral International Intraocular Retinoblastoma Classification Group E eyes and CSF metastasis was treated with 7-cycle high-dose carboplatin and etoposide, standard-dose vincristine, and high-dose/short-infusion cyclosporine to inhibit P-glycoprotein. Intraventricular drugs, non-substrate of P-glycoprotein (cytarabine), or less susceptible to MDR (topotecan), contributed to treatment of the metastasis. On achieving complete response, he was consolidated with supralethal-dosage carboplatin, etoposide, and cyclophosphamide, and his bone marrow rescued with autologous cord blood stem cells. Following 1-cycle systemic chemotherapy and 2-dose intraventricular chemotherapy, the CSF metastasis cleared. The right eye tumor regressed completely. The patient remains in remission 8.3 Years after diagnosis and 7.8 Years post-transplant.

We applied air-plombage method for empyema as a new operative technique. The patient was a 56-year-old man who had had 37 plastic balls implanted for the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis 39 years ago. In April 1988 he was admitted to our department complaining bloody sputum and high fever. Roentogenographic findings revealed residual middle lobe with normal size and plastic balls some with niveau. From these findings, the case was diagnosed as partial empyema after plastic ball plombage. In June 1988 air-plombage method was performed. At 5 months after operation, reinflation of the residual pulmonary lobe was seen accompanying improvement of pulmonary functions; FVC increased from 1780 ml to 1910 ml and blood gas PaO2 from 75.0 MmHg to 88.3 MmHg. Blood loss during operation was about 2,000 ml, which was smaller than the conventionally experienced amount of blood loss. Because of residual right middle lobe, pulmonary decortication was impossible and significant reinflation of the collapsed pulmonary lobe could not be expected. We selected air-plombage method rather than thoracoplasty as postoperative worsening of pulmonary functions was anticipated by the latter. Postoperative improvement of pulmonary functions could be explained by reinflation of the residual lobe due to removal of plastic balls and the capsule. When conventional thoracoplasty is carried out to obtain satisfying closure of the empyema cavity, pulmonary functions are always deteriorated, while air-plombage method is followed by slight improvement of pulmonary functions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"Empyema\", \"Symptoms\": [\"Bloody sputum\", \"high feve\"], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"Air-plombage method\", \"CureRate\": \"1\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [\"Roentgenographic findings\"], \"Causes\": \"Partial empyema after plastic ball plombage\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"had 37 plastic balls implanted for the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis 39 years ago\"}]}"}]}

Pylori infection in peptic ulcer patients significantly reduces the risk of ulcer recurrence. Since data on the rate of H. Pylori reinfection in patients undergoing successful anti-H. Pylori therapy are sparse, this study was conducted with the aim of determining the H. Pylori reinfection rate in peptic ulcer patients receiving antibacterial treatment to heal their ulcer and cure H. Pylori infection. A total of 217 patients with H. Pylori-associated duodenal or gastric ulcer were followed up after treatment with various antibacterial regimens resulting in histologically documented cure of H. Pylori infection. Endoscopic and histological examinations were performed 4 weeks after completion of treatment and after 1, 2 and 5 years, or whenever dyspeptic symptoms occurred. To assess the H. Pylori status two antral and two corpus biopsies were obtained for histological examination. Out of 217 patients with initially cured H. Pylori infection 175 were available for endoscopic follow-up. At the time of analysis, 44 patients were re-examined after 1 year, 113 patients after 2 years and 18 patients after 5 years, giving a total of 360 patient years of follow-up. The mean duration of follow-up was 24.7 Months. H. Pylori reinfection was confirmed histologically in eight patients, three of whom becoming H. Pylori-positive again within the first year of follow-up. Six of the eight patients with H. Pylori reinfection also suffered an ulcer relapse. Eight cases of reinfection in 360 patient years represents an overall reinfection rate of 2.2%. Within the first 2 years of follow-up the reinfection rate was 0.8% Per year. Our data suggest that H. Pylori reinfection is rare in peptic ulcer patients receiving successful anti-H. Pylori therapy. H. Pylori reinfection frequently coincides with ulcer recurrence. Cure of H. Pylori infection results in cure of peptic ulcer disease, provided H.

Discriminating between these 2 conditions is therapeutically important because nonmalignant CHP often improves under cyclosporine and prednisone, whereas most cases of SPLT may be best treated with more aggressive therapy. We report the cases of a 6-month-old boy and a 16-month-old girl who, after viral infection, developed multiple infiltrating skin nodules on the limbs and face, associated with MAS. Histopathologic findings for skin biopsy specimens revealed CHP associated with heavily cellular lobular panniculitis. Hemophagocytosis and immunohistochemical staining features were consistent with typical characteristics of in situ MAS in adipose tissue: the lymphocytes were mostly TCD8+ cells with an activated phenotype (human leukocyte antigen (HLA) -DR+) and expressed interferon-&#x3b3;; CD68+ macrophages expressed tumor necrosis factor-&#x3b1; And interleukin-6. A monoclonal rearrangement of the T-cell receptor &#x3b3; Gene was present in skin tissue but not in peripheral blood or bone marrow lymphocytes. Cyclosporine A treatment resulted in the complete remission of cutaneous and systemic manifestations in both patients for 66 and 29 months, respectively. This report suggests that the diagnosis of a reactive T-cell lymphoproliferation should be the treatment of choice in young children with severe CHP, even if there is a SPTCL-like aspect with an in situ T-cell clonality. It also suggests that CSA is the optimal treatment of this condition and postulates the possible pathologic process underlying this efficacy.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"Cytophagic histiocytic panniculitis (CHP) with heavily cellular lobular panniculitis\", \"Symptoms\": [\"Multiple infiltrating skin nodules on the limbs and face\"], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"Cyclosporine A\", \"CureRate\": \"1\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [\"Histopathologic findings for skin biopsy specimens\"], \"Causes\": \"Associated with MAS\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

The persistence of CVB has been described in vitro and in vivo in various models. Fluoxetine was reported to inhibit the replication of CVB1-3, which prompted us to study the in vitro antiviral activity of fluoxetine against CVB4 in models of acute infection. In addition we took advantage of a chronically CVB4-infected Panc-1 cell line to evaluate the antiviral effect of fluoxetine in a model of persistent CVB4 infection. An inhibition of the CVB4 replication was obtained when fluoxetine was added at 5.48&#X3bc;M to Hep-2 cell cultures. No inhibitory effect was observed when CVB4 was mixed with fluoxetine for 2h and filtered to eliminate fluoxetine before inoculation to cells, or when cells were treated up to 96h and washed before viral inoculation. Fluoxetine (5.48&#X3bc;M) reduced viral replication by more than 50% in acutely infected Panc-1 cell cultures. A dramatic decrease of infectious particles levels in supernatants of Panc-1 cells chronically infected with CVB4 was obtained a few days after treatment with fluoxetine and no infectious viral particle was found as soon as day 21 of treatment, and intracellular enteroviral RNA was undetectable by RT-PCR after three weeks of treatment. These data display that fluoxetine can inhibit the replication of CVB4 and can cure Panc-1 cells chronically infected with CVB4.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"Group B Coxsackieviruses (CVB)\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"Fluoxetine\", \"CureRate\": \"1\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"5.48\\u5a13\\u748f\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [\"RT-PCR\"], \"Causes\": \"Coxsackievirus B4 infection\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

We present the case of a 69-year old female patient who was hospitalized in the 1st Surgical Clinic for irritative dry cough, loss of weight (4 kg in the last 3 months), fatigue, itching and dyspnea. She had been hospitalized in a department of internal medicine for respiratory symptoms when, during X-ray investigation, an opacity was observed, which was suggestive for a pulmonary hydatid cyst. The abdominal ultrasound revealed a multiple hydatid localization (liver, spleen, lower right abdominal quadrant and hypogastrium) and the patient was sent to our clinic. The patient was treated with albendazole 10 mg/kg/day for 10 days before surgery. Surgery was performed by a minimally invasive approach, first by thoracoscopy and, in the same operative session, the other hydatid localizations were approached by laparoscopy. The parasiticide treatment was continued about 3 months after surgery, when the patient was hospitalized again in order to cure the splenic hydatid cyst. Postoperative evolution was complicated by a biliary fistula which resolved spontaneously in 10 days after the intervention. The postoperative hospital stay was 14 days. This case was unusual because of the paucity of symptoms in spite of the multiple abdominal cysts and because it was cured by a modern, minimally invasive approach.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"Hydatid disease\", \"Symptoms\": [\"Irritative dry cough\", \"loss of weight\", \"fatigue\", \"itching\", \"dyspnea\"], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"Albendazole\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"10 mg/kg/day for 10 days\"}, {\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"Minimally invasive therapy\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}, {\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"The parasiticide treatment\", \"CureRate\": \"1\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [\"X-ray\", \"Abdominal ultrasound\"], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

Humans depend on vitamin B3 for biosynthesis of NAD<sup>+</sup>, indispensable for many metabolic and NAD<sup>+</sup>-consuming signaling reactions. The balance between its utilization and resynthesis is vitally important. Many extra-pulmonary symptoms of COVID-19 strikingly resemble those of pellagra, vitamin B3 deficiency (e.G., Diarrhoea, dermatitis, oral cavity and tongue manifestations, loss of smell and taste, mental confusion). In most developed countries, pellagra is successfully eradicated by vitamin B3 fortification programs. Thus, conceivably, it has not been suspected as a cause of COVID-19 symptoms. Here, the deregulation of the NAD<sup>+</sup> metabolism in response to the SARS-CoV-2 infection is reviewed, with special emphasis on the differences in the NAD<sup>+</sup> biosynthetic pathway's efficiency in conditions predisposing for the development of serious COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 infection-induced NAD<sup>+</sup> depletion and the elevated levels of its metabolites contribute to the development of a systemic disease. Acute liberation of nicotinamide (NAM) in antiviral NAD<sup>+</sup>-consuming reactions potentiates \"NAM drain\", cooperatively mediated by nicotinamide N-methyltransferase and aldehyde oxidase. \"NAM drain\" compromises the NAD<sup>+</sup> salvage pathway's fail-safe function. The robustness of the host's NAD<sup>+</sup> salvage pathway, prior to the SARS-CoV-2 infection, is an important determinant of COVID-19 severity and persistence of certain symptoms upon resolution of infection.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"Secondary Pellagra\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"vitamin B3 fortification programs\", \"CureRate\": \"1\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"SARS-CoV-2 infection \", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

However, clinical trials report higher rates of appropriate ICD therapies in implanted patients than untreated patient mortality rates would predict. This study sought to describe a newly recognized form of ventricular proarrhythmia related to the mechanical presence of the ICD. Four ICD patients were referred for management of recurrent ventricular tachycardia (VT) refractory to medications and catheter ablation. All were treated with lead extraction and followed prospectively for arrhythmia recurrence. Two patients received ICDs for primary prevention because of a family history of sudden death and nonischemic cardiomyopathy, respectively. Episodes of VT with ICD therapies began 2 months and 1 year after implantation, and continued for 3 months and 5 years, respectively, until referral. Two secondary prevention ICD patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy developed incessant VT within 1 day and 3 days after implantation with multiple ICD shocks. VT was not suppressed by antiarrhythmic drugs, and catheter ablation failed in 2 patients. In all patients, spontaneous VT's had a QRS morphology similar to the paced morphology from the ICD leads, raising suspicion of lead-related proarrhythmia. After lead extraction, primary prevention ICD patients remained free of VT during follow-up periods of 17 and 21 months, and VT storm was controlled in the secondary prevention patients. ICD leads can cause uncontrollable VT until the lead is extracted, suggesting a mechanical effect. In contrast to transient ectopy that occurs early after implantation, this proarrhythmia can be chronic. Recognition is important because lead extraction is curative and can prevent unnecessary ICD shocks, antiarrhythmic medications, and catheter ablation.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"Recurrent ventricular tachycardia (VT)\", \"Symptoms\": [\" Ventricular proarrhythmia\"], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"Lead extraction\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"ischemic cardiomyopathy\"}]}"}]}

As the control of bacteria and the surgical intervention are both important in the treatment of pyothorax cases, we tried to reduce MRSA by washing with Povidone-Iodine solution through the drain. Then, we selected Air-plombage method as it is expected to maintain or to increase the pulmonary function after operation. We could easily close the bronchial fistula with a muscle flap, as it was located at the centre of the cavity. During the operation we frequently used acidic electrolyzed NaCl solution against MRSA.

We present what we regard as a new clinical entity - long-standing limited mouth opening of unknown cause - and describe our treatment. Four female patients presented with limited mouth opening and lateral and protrusive movements within normal limits, which were typical of restriction of extra-articular origin. However, the radiological findings were within normal limits, with no visible cause of the restriction. All four were treated by bilateral coronoidectomy that resulted in the immediate return of mouth opening to within normal limits that was preserved over subsequent years. Histopathological examination showed atrophy and degenerative changes in the temporalis band that had been attached to the coronoid, which accounts for the stiffness of the temporalis muscle but does not explain the pathogenesis.

However, several cases have been reported to have unsatisfactory responses to the initial PZQ treatment. The objective of this study was to evaluate the clinical findings of patients with pleuropulmonary paragonimiasis who needed additional PZQ treatment after the 1st set chemotherapy. Thirty-two patients who were diagnosed with pleuropulmonary paragonimiasis at our institution between 2003 and 2008 were retrospectively reviewed. All patients were treated initially with PZQ for 3 days (1st set chemotherapy). Twenty-four patients (75.0%) Showed improvement in respiratory symptoms and pulmonary involvements. However, eight patients (25.0%) Suffered from relapsed respiratory symptoms and pleural effusion. For these patients, an additional 2nd set PZQ treatment resulted in the resolution of the symptoms and pulmonary involvements.

A 68-year-old man presented with an asymptomatic bronchial tumor in the right intermediate bronchus. The tumor was resected using a high-frequency snare (HFS) during bronchoscopy, and the specimen was pathologically diagnosed as low-grade MEC. A residual lesion was detected in the resected area by autofluorescence imaging. The tumor appeared to be localized within the subepithelial layer without metastases, and photodynamic therapy (PDT) was performed as a local treatment.

Recently, intraluminal bronchoscopic treatment (IBT) has emerged as an option for curative treatment, not just surgery, in patients with central early-stage SqCC (CES-SqCC). However, patients that can be cured by IBT are limited. We report a rare case of CES-SqCC that was surgically confirmed to be cured by IBT alone. A 72-year-old woman had a nodular bronchial tumor at the bifurcation of right upper and intermediate bronchi. For histological diagnosis, the tumor was resected and incinerated using high-frequency snare (HFS). Obtained specimens were diagnosed as SqCC; Wedge resection of the bifurcation was performed to remove the residual lesion. However, no malignant findings were found in the excised specimens. Some patients with CES-SqCC may be cured by aggressive diagnostic bronchoscopy. The risk of postoperative complications cannot be ignored because the surgery requires bronchoplasty in patients with CES-SqCC. For patients with CES-SqCC, surgical resection may be avoided by detailed assessment of residual lesion with radial probe endobronchial ultrasonography (RP-EBUS).\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"Nodular-type central squamous cell lung carcinoma\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"intraluminal bronchoscopic treatment (IBT)\", \"CureRate\": \"1\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

We present 3 cases of pseudoaneurysm following ankle sprain, treated by nonsurgical methods in 2 cases, and spontaneously healed in another. The diagnosis was made between 2 and 4 weeks after traumatism, by ultrasonography and arteriography in 2 cases, and only by ultrasonography in a third case. The pseudoaneurysms originated respectively from the perforating fibular artery, the dorsal pedis artery, and a lateral malleolar artery. Largest diameters of the pseudoaneurysms ranged from 2.4 To 6&#xa0;Cm. Patients were successfully treated by thrombin injection in 1 case and by coil embolization in another.

Review of the literature].\nAbstract: Rickets secondary to bone or soft tissue tumors are rare in children. Majority of the reported cases occurred in adults older than thirty. This entity can be cured after tumor removal. The authors present 1 case in a ten year boy and literature review. A ten year boy complained of diffuse bone and muscle weakness for two years. A diagnosis of arthritis was made but the patient continued to complain. Serum calcium level was normal (2.33 Mmol/l), phosphorus was very low (0.43 Mmol/l), serum alkaline phosphatase was high, parathyroid hormone and vitamin D level were normal. Urinalysis showed abnormal phosphate excretion. The absence of malabsorption, no family history of rickets or hypophosphatermy presence of a marked excess of urinary phosphate, very low serum phosphate and normal serum calcium, vitamin D and parathyroid hormone levels led us to consider a diagnosis of tumor induced osteomalacia. Radiographs showed a large round radiolucent lesion in the left superior pubic ramus and generalized demineralisation. We performed a complete tumor resection and the space was filled with bone graft. On histopathologic examination it was a benign mesenchymal tumor. Rapid reversal of biochemical anomalies, radiographs anomalies and clinical manifestation were observed after complete tumor resection. The authors have described the tumor, the osteomalacia and the pathogenesis of tumor rickets. Histologically the most common causative tumors were vascular tumors, mesenchymal tumors and non ossifying tumors. The tumor were of bone or soft tissue origin. Clinical symptoms were muscular weakness, bone and muscle pain. Biochemically there is a very low phosphate level, a normal serum calcium level as well as a normal vitamin D and PTH level. There is a significant high level of urinal phosphate. The mechanism proposed to explain oncogenic osteomalacia includes tumor secretion of phosphaturic substance other than PTH and calcitonin.

Impedance-pH monitoring can identify PPI-refractory patients who could benefit from laparoscopic fundoplication, but outcome data are scarce. We aimed to assess whether PPI-refractory GERD as diagnosed by impedance-pH monitoring can be cured by laparoscopic fundoplication. Forty-four consecutive GERD patients with heartburn/regurgitation refractory to high-dose PPI therapy entered a 3-year outcome assessment following robot-assisted laparoscopic fundoplication. Preoperative on-PPI impedance-pH diagnostic criteria consisted of positive symptom association probability (SAP)/symptom index (SI), and/or abnormal percentage esophageal acid exposure time (%EAET), and/or abnormal number of total refluxes. GERD cure was defined by 3-year postoperative off-PPI normal impedance-pH findings with persistent symptom remission. Preoperatively, 24 of 38 (63 %) patients who completed the outcome assessment had a positive SAP/SI, 20 of 38 (53 %) for weakly acidic refluxes; 3 Of 38 (8 %) patients had an abnormal %EAET, 11 of 38 (29 %) an abnormal number of total refluxes only. Postoperatively, heartburn/regurgitation recurred in 3 patients; Abnormal impedance-pH findings were found in two of them, and they responded to PPI therapy. GERD cure was achieved in 34 of 38 (89 %) patients, 11 of 11 with an abnormal number of total refluxes as the only preoperative abnormal impedance-pH finding. Postoperatively, there was a significant decrease of the %EAET (1 vs. 0.1 %, P = 0.002) And of the number of total refluxes (68 vs. 8, P = 0.001), With the latter finding mainly due to a decrease in the number of weakly acidic refluxes. Normal reflux parameters and persistent symptom remission at 3-year follow-up can be achieved with laparoscopic fundoplication in the majority of patients with PPI-refractory GERD as diagnosed by impedance-pH monitoring. On-PPI impedance-pH diagnostic criteria should include SAP/SI positivity, an abnormal %EAET, and an abnormal number of total refluxes. Weakly acidic refluxes have a major role in the pathogenesis of PPI-refractory GERD.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"Refractory gastroesophageal reflux disease \", \"Symptoms\": [\"Heartburn/regurgitation\"], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"robot-assisted laparoscopic fundoplication\", \"CureRate\": \"0.89\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [\"Impedance-pH monitoring\"], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

For papillomas of the tongue, surgery is recommended owing to their malignant potential; However, certain complications may be associated with surgery. A traditional Japanese (Kampo) herbal medicine, Keishibukuryogan-ka-yokuinin (KBGY), has been used to treat viral warts and various skin diseases in Japan. Therefore, the effect of KBGY on papillomas is promising. A 49-year-old Japanese man presented with a wart on his tongue that was about 3&#xa0;Months old. He smoked 5 cigarettes per day. He did not drink alcohol. He had no history of malignant illnesses. He was taking alprazolam for panic disorder. The patient was diagnosed with a suspected papilloma of the tongue at the Department of Otolaryngology and was advised to undergo an excision biopsy to exclude malignancy. However, he refused owing to the fear of an invasive procedure. After informed consent was obtained from the patient, KBGY was prescribed. Three months later, the wart on his tongue spontaneously prolapsed. The histopathological diagnosis was squamous papilloma. There was no indication of malignancy, and the patient discontinued Kampo treatment. He has had no recurrence in the past 3&#xa0;Years. KBGY is a combination of Keishibukuryogan and yokuinin (adlay seeds). Keishibukuryogan may be beneficial for skin or oral mucosal remodeling, and yokuinin may have antiviral properties.

No report has been issued on an SMT-like gastric cancer cured by endoscopic resection alone or on changes in the endoscopic features of this type of tumor over several years. We describe an exceptional case of a 53-year-old male with a 1.5 Cm-sized SMT-like lesion covered by normal-appearing mucosa discovered by esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) at the gastric antrum. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) visualized a homogeneous, well-circumscribed hypoechogenic lesion arising from the second sonographic layer with associated subtle obliteration of the third sonographic layer. Initial endoscopic biopsy was negative for neoplasm. The patient refused to undergo an invasive procedure and was subsequently lost to follow-up. Three years after initial detection, EGD revealed the lesion had become markedly erythematous, and at 4 years after initial EGD it had increased in size to 1.8 Cm and developed a central ulcer and a heterogeneous EUS echo. Finally, endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) was performed, and histopathologic examination revealed a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma had minutely invaded the submucosal layer (invasion depth 169 &#x3bc;M) but without lymphovascular invasion and with negative resection margins. Fortunately, no additional surgical treatment was required. He has been followed for 4 years after ESD without any evidence of local or distant recurrence. This report describes an extremely rare case of early gastric cancer presenting as SMT that was cured by ESD after a treatment delay of 4 years and the endoscopic changes that occurred during this period.

The aim of the present study was to identify stage-related factors and patient characteristics influencing survival after complete resection. We identified 395 patients with non-small cell lung cancer who had undergone potentially radical operation during 1987 to 1999 at one thoracic surgery institution in central Sweden. Factors independently related to survival were identified in a multivariate analysis. Survival was analyzed in low-, medium-, and high-risk groups based on a risk score calculated from relative hazards for identified risk factors. Overall 5-year survival among the 395 patients was 51%. The strongest factor predicting prognosis was positive lymph nodes at operation. Higher age, earlier period for operation, impaired lung function, current smoking, and major operative complication were all related to poorer prognosis. Patients with tumor stage Ia had a 5-year survival of 69%, compared to 73% in patients in the low-risk group. Tumor stage is the best prognostic indicator after radical operation. Inclusion of other tumor- and patient-related variables did not add prognostic information of clinical relevance beyond that provided by tumor stage alone.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"Radical operation\", \"CureRate\": \"0.51\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

We aimed to clarify whether hemithyroidectomy with diagnostic ipsilateral central neck dissection can replace total thyroidectomy with routine central neck dissection in patients with sporadic medullary thyroid cancer. We retrospectively evaluated data collected from patients who had undergone primary neck surgery for hypercalcitoninemic sporadic medullary thyroid cancer between January 2017 and December 2022 at one institution. Of the 25 patients we examined, 19 had desmoplasia-negative and 6 desmoplasia-positive primary thyroid tumors on frozen section. The desmoplasia-negative patients had undergone less surgery with fewer nodes removed than the desmoplasia-positive patients (medians of 6 vs 31 nodes, P&#xa0;< .001). The desmoplasia-negative patients had predominantly undergone hemithyroidectomy with ipsilateral central neck dissection. None of the desmoplasia-negative tumors was multifocal (0 of 19 desmoplasia-negative vs 2 of 6 desmoplasia-positive or 0% vs 33%, P&#xa0;= .050) Or node-positive (0 of 19 vs 6 of 6 patients or 0% vs 100%; Medians of 0 vs 3.5 Node metastases; Both P < .001).

However, the involvement of CAIX specific CD8+ T cells and/or NK cells in the tumor eradication is unknown. We investigated T cell and antibody reactivity against overlapping 15-mer CAIX-peptides as well as HLA haplotype frequency and NK cell cytotoxicity in 11 patients with no evidence of disease (NED) following treatment with IL-2 based immunotherapy, and thus potentially cured. Immune reactivity in these patients was compared with samples from patients with dramatic tumor response obtained immediately at the cessation of therapy, samples from patients that experienced progressive disease during treatment and samples from healthy controls. We observed more focused but only weak and not consistent CAIX specific T-cells in the late observation and early observation response groups compared with the healthy control group. An increased frequency of the class II alleles HLA-DRB4 01:01, HLA-DPB 01:01 and HLA-DPB 03:01 was noted in the NED patients. In contrast, NK cytotoxicity was low even in the late observation response group as compared with controls. In particular, a HLA-B*40:01 restricted CD8+ T cell response recognizing the CAIX- derived peptide SEEEGSLKL was identified.

ACTH-producing pituitary adrenomas are, however, often small in size not detectable with neuro-imaging techniques, which may result in difficulties during their surgical removal. With the advent of rapid methods for plasma ACTH measurement, a few neurosurgical centers introduced intra-operative plasma ACTH determinations in peripheral and central blood samples to help improve the outcome of pituitary surgery in patients with Cushing's disease. To evaluate the usefulness of this new method, we performed, under standardized conditions, intra-operative plasma ACTH measurements with a rapid immunochemiluminometric method at different stages of transsphenoidal pituitary surgery in 7 patients with Cushing's disease. We found that from the beginning of anesthesia until the end of operation, ACTH concentrations in venous plasma were highly variable by both the rapid and the standard methods. In most cases the changes in venous plasma ACTH concentrations that occurred until the end of surgery failed to indicate the removal of the ACTH-producing pituitary adenoma. However, a more than 50% decrease of venous plasma ACTH concentrations by the rapid assay was observed 2 h after completion of the operation in all but one of the patients. As evidenced by a long-term hormonal and clinical remission, these changes in plasma ACTH levels in all patients were accompanied by a complete removal of the ACTH-producing pituitary adenoma. These findings indicate a slow disappearance of ACTH from the circulation after a successful pituitary surgery in patients with Cushing's disease.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"Cushing's disease\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"transsphenoidal pituitary surgery\", \"CureRate\": \"1\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [\"Rapid immunochemiluminometric method\"], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"Cushing's disease\"}]}"}]}

Forty-two patients with CHB were enrolled. All patients had been treated with peginterferon (Peg-IFN) in combination with nucleoside analogue (NA) therapy for variable amounts of time, and all had been successfully cured of the disease. The combined treatment time for all participants was 124.7 &#Xb1; 58.8 Weeks, and the average Peg-IFN treatment time was 102.6 &#Xb1; 56.1 Weeks. At 24 weeks, Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and Hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) had decreased more than 50% from baseline. Multivariate logistic regression analysis of the week 96 HBsAg-clearing group and the non-HBsAg-clearing group showed a statistically significant difference in baseline HBV DNA levels and week 48 HBsAg levels. Those which baseline HBV DNA was < 2.75 Log10 IU/mL, and week 48 HBsAg levels were < 0.88 Log10 IU/mL were more likely to achieve rapid HBsAg clearance at 96 weeks. This suggests that low levels of baseline HBV DNA and week 48 HBsAg are a predictor of rapid HBsAg clearance at 96 weeks. Individualized extension of combination therapy to more than 96 weeks depending on the patient's response and adverse reaction conditions can help achieve a clinical cure. Patients with low baseline HBV DNA and low HBsAg levels at 48 weeks achieve HBsAg clearance more quickly than other populations.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"chronic hepatitis B (CHB) \", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"Peginterferon (Peg-IFN) in combination with nucleoside analogue (NA) therapy\", \"CureRate\": \"1\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [\"Clinical characteristics analysis\"], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

To our knowledge we present the largest series of patients with cystic renal cell carcinoma with long-term followup. We reviewed the Mayo Clinic surgical pathology files of renal cell cancer cases with a cystic component resected from 1969 to 1997, and arbitrarily chose 75% tumor involvement by cysts as a cutoff for inclusion in the study. We identified 24 cases of clear cell renal cell carcinoma with 75% or greater involvement by cysts comprising 0.79% Of 3,047 renal cell cancer cases resected at our institution between 1969 and 1997. Mean patient age was 62.7 Years (range 40 to 83). A total of 11 patients (46%) underwent radical nephrectomy, 4 (17%) simple nephrectomy, 3 (12%) partial nephrectomy and 6 (25%) tumor enucleation. Mean tumor involvement by cysts was 84% (range 75 to 95) and in 11 cases (46%) involvement was 90% or greater. Cancer stage was T1 in 20 patients (83%), T2 in 1 (4.4%) And T3a in 4 (12.5%).

This study was devised to investigate the prevalence of alexithymia and sleep disorders in patients maintenance hemodialysis with insuppressible secondary hyperparathyroidism, who need parathyroidectomy (PTX), because previous data from our laboratories as well as those of others showed that this patient-group are the worst sleepers among hemodialysis patients with end-stage renal disease. A total of 40 patients needing PTX were enrolled and studied before the surgery. As for the control group, 80 patients on maintenance hemodialysis not needing PTX were enrolled. We measured alexithymia with the Toronto Alexithymia Score (TAS-20), sleep disorders with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and depression with Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH), calcium, phosphate, use of antihypertensives, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, hemoglobin concentration, and albumin concentration. Patients needing PTX in comparison with those not needing PTX had significantly higher iPTH, calcium, and phosphate; They also had significantly higher systolic and diastolic blood pressure. They were more significantly alexithymic (P < .001), Had more severe sleep disorders (P < .001), And were more depressed (P < .043). In multivariate analysis, BDI correlated significantly with iPTH concentration (r = 0.505, P < .001). A reduction of TAS-20 occurred after PTX which correlated with the number of patients on antihypertensive drugs, PSQI, BDI, hemoglobin concentration in the univariate and multivariate analysis. When TAS-20 and PSQI were adjusted for BDI (using analysis of variance) there was still a significant difference of TAS-20 and PSQI between patients needing PTX and not needing PTX (P < .001). This study confirms the high prevalence of sleep disorders in patients with unsuppressed secondary hyperparathyroidism and discloses a high prevalence of Alexithymia which is ameliorated by PTX. However, the correlation of Alexithymia with sleep disorders does not depend on depression.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"secondary hyperparathyroidism\", \"Symptoms\": [\"Alexithymia\", \"Sleep disorders\", \"Depression\"], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"Parathyroidectomy (PTX)\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [\"Toronto Alexithymia Score (TAS-20)\", \"Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)\", \"Beck Depression Inventory (BDI)\"], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \" hemodialyzed patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism\"}]}"}]}

To date, there are no treatments of proven value in this regard. One underexplored route to slow the neurodegenerative process is the use of agents that may stimulate neurogenesis in the subventricular zone. In animal models of PD, PDGF-BB has been shown to restore/protect against dopaminergic deficits caused by neurotoxins via increased neurogenesis in the subventricular zone. Previous work suggests that these new cells are not themselves dopaminergic but have trophic effects on residual dopaminergic cells in the substantia nigra. In this issue of the JCI, Paul et al. Evaluate this agent in individuals with PD and show that i.C.V. Administration of PDGF-BB is safe and well tolerated. This study lays the foundation for formal dose-finding studies and clinical trials to assess the efficacy of this agent as a potential neuroprotective treatment for PD.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"Parkinson's disease (PD)\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"PDGF-BB\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

A critical review of the book You can conquer cancer by Ian Gawler.\nAbstract: There is a widespread belief that cancer is caused, at least in part, by aberrant mental processes. A corollary of this belief is that cancer may be cured by the application of the mind. These ideas are fostered in Australia by a popular book You can conquer cancer by Ian Gawler, a veterinary surgeon who attributes, at least in part, the development and subsequent cure of his own cancer to such processes. Critical examination of these beliefs finds evidence in their support to be lacking. None the less, many patients with cancer in this country follow the book's advice, often on the basis that it \"at least can do no harm\". While some patients may be aided to come to terms with their disease and to lead more fulfilling lives by taking up meditation and the positive approach to living that is described in the book, it also contains recommendations about orthodox treatments, life-style and diet which, if adopted uncritically, could be quite detrimental. The potentially harmful effects of accepting such unproved ideas about cancer need to be known more widely. Furthermore, because his ideas are making such an impact on the day-to-day treatment of cancer in this country, Gawler owes it to the community to justify, with evidence, his claims that by meditation patients with cancer may be enabled to achieve a cure of their disease in a way that is unattainable with orthodox medical treatment alone.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"Cancer \", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"Meditation and \\\"natural therapy\\\"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

We reviewed 46 patients who underwent curative-intent RT for local recurrence after lobectomy or pneumonectomy accompanied with mediastinal lymph node dissection between 2002 and 2014. We analyzed overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), local control, tumour response and the re-recurrence pattern. Among the 46 patients, 16 received concurrent chemotherapy. The median follow-up period was 48&#xa0;Months. The response rate was 91%. The 5-year OS and local control rates were 47.9 And 65.3%, Respectively, and the 5-year PFS rate was 22.8%. Female sex and complete response to radiation were favourable prognostic factors. Of the 33 patients with recurrence after radiation, 32 (97%) had distant metastasis. Although RT for local recurrence has high efficacy, distant relapse after radiation remains a major issue. Therefore, combination systemic therapy for local recurrence at any site should be further investigated.

Computerized tomography (CT) revealed splenic aneurysm, dilated splenic vein enhanced in the arterial phase, ascites, and intestinal edema. We considered that these findings were caused by portal hypertension due to splenic arteriovenous fistula. The splenic aneurysm was managed with coil embolization. Completion arteriography revealed the absence of flow into the splenic arteriovenous fistula. Surveillance CT scans at 2 months post-procedure confirmed complete occlusion of the aneurysm and arteriovenous fistula. There was no evidence of splenic infarction.

The relevant literature is reviewed, and the current understanding of oncogenic osteomalacia is summarized. In September 1996, a 44-year-old black woman presented with a 2-year history of bone pain, progressive muscle weakness, depression, osteomalacia, and hypophosphatemia. Her condition did not improve with use of calcitriol and phosphate replacement. During the previous year, her serum phosphorus levels were low, ranging from 1.0 To 2.2 Mg/dL, and the levels of serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25-(OH)2D] were very low, ranging from <5 to 19.4 Pg/mL (normal, 15 to 60). The serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were low, ranging from 8 to 14 ng/mL (normal, 9 to 52). The higher values were noted after she had received large doses of phosphate, 1,25-(OH)2D, and vitamin D. During the previous year, her serum alkaline phosphatase levels were high, ranging from 253 to 314 U/L; Serum calcium and parathyroid hormone levels were normal. The abnormalities on physical examination were obesity and a 10- by 10-cm firm, poorly demarcated mass superior to the left greater trochanter. A computed tomographic scan of this region showed a water-density fluid collection in the left buttock measuring 7.8 By 7.8 Cm, consistent with a chronic hematoma. The mass was resected, and histopathologic examination revealed features of an organized hematoma with areas of myxoid changes and cartilaginous metaplasia. Postoperatively, the patient's strength improved, and the levels of serum phosphorus and 1,25-(OH)2D became supranormal. The symptoms and laboratory abnormalities of this patient with oncogenic osteomalacia promptly resolved after resection of an organized hematoma of the left hip.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"Oncogenic osteomalacia\", \"Symptoms\": [\"Bone pain\", \"progressive muscle weakness\"], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"Calcitriol and phosphate replacement\", \"CureRate\": \"0\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}, {\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"Surgical removal of an organized hematoma\", \"CureRate\": \"1\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [\"Computed tomographic scan\"], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"2-year history of bone pain, progressive muscle weakness, depression, osteomalacia, and hypophosphatemia\"}]}"}]}

From May 2014 to April 2015, 135 patients with symptoms like unexplained syncope and presyncope were administrated in our hospital, including 60 boys and 75 girls, aged between 4 and 16 (10.2&#Xb1;2.7) Years. After head-up tilt test (HUTT), their electrolytes in serum and urine were examined. Those who were positive to the HUTT received ORS and health education, while others were only treated by health education. With the period of subsequent visit arranging 21-154 (42.6&#Xb1;27.7) Days, the improvement of their clinical manifestation were inquired and electrolytes in serum and urine were re-tested. (1) The total effective percentage of ORS treatment was 63.0%, And the negative conversion rate of HUTT was 48.2%. (2) In the first time of visit to hospital, there was no statistical significance between the HUTT-positive and the HUTT- negative in serum electrolytes, 24-h urine electrolytes and 24-h urine volume (P>0.05). (3) In the return visit to hospital, the serum calcium and serum phosphorus in the HUTT-positive were higher than those in the HUTT-negative (P<0.05). (4) With the intake of ORS, 24-h urine sodium, 24-h urine chlorine and 24-h urine volume were improved than pre-treatment (P<0.05 Or 0.01). ORS was an effective treatment to the NMS children, with 24-h urine volume and urine chloride increasing.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"Nerve mediated syncope (NMS)\", \"Symptoms\": [\"unexplained syncope and presyncope\"], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"oral rehydration salts (ORS)\", \"CureRate\": \"0.63\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [\"Head-up tilt test (HUTT)\", \" Electrolytes in serum and urine were examined\"], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

A study from Mwanza region, Tanzania.\nAbstract: To estimate the proportion of symptomatic patients with a bacterial sexually transmitted infection (STI) cured by primary health care services in Mwanza Region, Tanzania, and to compare the cure rate achieved by health centres before and after the introduction of improved STI treatment services. A model was used that describes the different hurdles patients with an STI take before they can be considered cured by the health services. The values for the input parameters for the model were taken from different studies. Data from an intervention trial as well as from a population-based study on male urethritis were used to estimate the proportion of symptomatic patients with an STI who seek care from a health centre. An observational study in four health centres where improved STI treatment services had been introduced provided estimates of the proportions of patients with an STI correctly diagnosed and treated. Patients who returned to the health centres after 1 week were interviewed about compliance. An estimate of the efficacy of treatments prescribed for STIs in health centres before the introduction of improved STI services was obtained from a study on prescription patterns for genital discharge syndrome (GDS) and genital ulcer disease (GUD). It was estimated that in the catchment area of health centres offering improved STI services, 51-72% of patients with STI symptoms sought care from those health centres. About 76-85% of cases were correctly diagnosed, and of these 69-80% received efficacious treatment. Compliance with full treatment was estimated at 84%. The estimated overall cure rate achieved by the health centres offering improved STI services ranged between 23 and 41%. The proportion of symptomatic STI patients who attended a health centre before improved STI services were introduced was estimated at 39%. The estimated efficacy of the treatments prescribed was 28%. The overall cure rate achieved by these health centres was less than 10%. When assessing the performance of STI case detection and management all steps have to be taken into account that are taken by patients with an STI before they can be considered cured by the health services. The intervention to improve STI services in Mwanza Region has resulted in an improvement of the cure rate of STIs achieved by primary health care centres.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"Bacterial sexually transmitted infection (STI) \", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"health services\", \"CureRate\": \"0.23-0.41\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"sexually transmitted infection \", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

The clinical and laboratory features of 2 cases of 8p11 meyloproliferative syndrome were summarized, including the diagnosis and treatment process of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Patient 1 was presented with bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy and leukocytosis. The pathology of bone marrow showed extremely hyperplasia. The cytogenetic analysis showed a 46, XY, (8;13)(P11;Q12) karyotype. The biopsy of the lymph node was peripheral T-cell lymphoma, unspecified. Patient 2 was presented with extensive lymphadenopathy with abnormal hemogram, which was leuekcytosis and thrombpenia. The bone marrow was hypercellular. The cytogenetic analysis on the bone marrow cells showed a translocation of t(8;9) (P11;Q32). The CEP110-FGFR1 fusion transcript was detected by RT-PCR. The biopsy of the lymph node was T lymphoblastic lymphoma. These two patients received human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-identical allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, remained disease-free and survived 16 years and 6 years after transplantation, respectively. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is the curative therapy for 8p11 meyloproliferative syndrome.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"8P11 meyloproliferative syndrome\", \"Symptoms\": [\"bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy and leukocytosis\"], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation\", \"CureRate\": \"1\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [\"pathology of bone marrow\", \"cytogenetic analysis\", \"biopsy of the lymph node\"], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

The diagnosis of autoimmune hepatitis was based on the presence of characteristic lesions at the examination of the liver biopsy specimen, high titer of anti-smooth muscle antibodies in the serum, and remission obtained by steroid therapy. Erythroid aplasia, which appeared during the course of this treatment, was revealed by a regenerative anemia (4.4 G Hb/100 ml) and proved by bone marrow aspiration and biopsy. In vitro bone marrow culture was normal, suggesting the in vivo presence of an inhibitor of erythroblastic differentiation. Red cell aplasia was cured by cyclophosphamide (100 mg/day during 56 days). No recurrence was noted until the death of the patient, which occurred one year later, due to hepatic cholangiocarcinoma. Action of cyclophosphamide on the pure red cell aplasia suggested the immune origin of this disease. The liver and the bone marrow erythroid lineage have probably been the successive targets of immunologic dyscrasia.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"autoimmune chronic active hepatitis and acquired erythroblastopenia\", \"Symptoms\": [\"regenerative anemia\"], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"Cyclophosphamide\", \"CureRate\": \"1\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"100 mg/day during 56 days\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [\"Liver biopsy\", \"Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy\"], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

The following hypothesis can be eliminated: resistance of E. Histolytica to metronidazole, poor absorption or faulty diffusion of the drug, its possible inactivation. The persistance of amoebae in the digestive tract, even if they are not detected, seems probable however: either because they are situated in such a way as to be inaccessible to the active metabolities of the metronidazole or because the intra-luminal concentration of these metabolites is not sufficient. The fact that the intestinal parasitism repeatedly leads to the constitution of successive hepatic abscesses in the same person presupposes the privileged anatomic situation of a colonic ulceration which brings about reiterated dissemination through the portal veinous system.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"Hepatic amoebiasis\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"Metronidazole\", \"CureRate\": \"1\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

However, radical surgery was impossible and the operation ended up as no more than exploratory laparotomy. Before closing, Cisplatin 100 mg and Etoposide 200 mg were instilled into the intraperitoneal cavity. Two courses of systemic chemotherapy with PAC (Cisplatin 50 mg, Pirarubicin 40 mg, Cyclophosphamide 400 mg) were instituted. To examine shrinkage of the hepatic metastasis and the peritoneal tumors, A \"Second look\" operation was conducted. Abdominal simple total hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, omentectomy and partial sigmoidectomy resulted in no residual lesions in the peritoneal cavity with the exception of the hepatic metastatic lesion (69 x 57 mm). Two additional courses of PAC therapy were administered after the \"Second look\" operation. The hepatic metastatic lesion shrank to 45 x 41 mm; a decrease of 83.8% compared to the pre-therapy in size. Liver function tests and tumor chemical markers (TPA, CA 125, SLX) revealed decreased values that were consistent with a tumor size reduction.

A variant treated by pancreatoduodenectomy.\nAbstract: Acute pancreatitis usually subsides spontaneously or is complicated by pseudocysts, pancreatic necrosis, or abscesses. We describe an uncommon variant of acute pancreatitis in which signs of inflammation persist over a number of months, waxing and waning but never disappearing. Neither identifiable collections nor other targets for surgical drainage develop in these patients, nor does their condition ever remit enough to allow them to leave the hospital. Eating provokes a flareup of inflammation. We have treated five such patients with a pancreatoduodenectomy (four patients) or total pancreatectomy (one patient). Each patient had been continuously hospitalized for six to 12 weeks before operation. All survived the operation and left the hospital eating solid food within 16 days. In addition to acute inflammation and fat necrosis, the resected specimens showed main pancreatic duct stenosis or occlusion in three patients, a pancreaticoduodenal fistula in one, and a congenital duplication cyst. Pancreatography or cholangiography showed the lesion in three of four cases and helped in planning therapy. Thus, acute pancreatitis may fall to remit because of proximal pancreatic duct obstruction, for which pancreatoduodenectomy is a reasonable and effective treatment.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"acute pancreatitis\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"pancreatoduodenectomy\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

Contrary to earlier beliefs, this tumor does not arise from the synovial lining of joints and bursa but develops from pleuripotential mesenchymal cells through abnormal differentiation into synovial neoplasms. Microscopically the tumor is characterized by a biphasic pattern of pseudoepithelial cells and a spindle cell element with fibrosarcomatous appearance. One additional case of synovial sarcoma of the endolarynx is reported. The tumor arose from the right subglottic area and presented submucosally. It was treated by extended frontolateral partial vertical (hemi) laryngectomy. The patient is alive and well 3 years after surgery.

She had no personal or family history of stigmas of tuberous sclerosis. On physical examination, a movable hard smooth mass of fist size was palpable in the right abdomen. Drip infusion pyelography revealed an elevation of right kidney. Ultrasonography revealed that the abdominal mass had a high amplitude echo area. On CT the mass was heterogeneous with irregular margin and had regions of low attenuation value, suspicious of a tumor with high fat content. An angiogram of the right renal artery revealed a hypervascular tumor showing multiple saccular aneurysms, and absence of arteriovenous shunting. Based on the aforementioned findings, the mass was diagnosed as renal angiomyolipoma. Partial right nephrectomy was performed through an extraperitoneal approach. Pathological diagnosis was a renal angiomyolipoma.

Selection of the patients was based solely on arteriographic criteria. Arteriography after dilatation showed considerable widening of the stenosed area in all patients. In 65 patients the effect of treatment on the blood pressure was assessed during follow up periods of one to four years. In 14 of these patients the hypertension was cured, in 29 it was improved, and in 22 there was no change. Patients with fibromuscular lesions benefited distinctly more than did those with atheromatous stenosis, only one of the 21 patients with fibromuscular lesions showing no change as compared with 21 of the 44 patients with atheromatous lesions. The only serious complication encountered was microcholesterol emboli, which developed in two patients with severe atheromatous lesions of the aorta. In the atheromatous group age and overall renal function had no influence on the blood pressure response. In the subgroup of patients with a unilateral lesion the renal vein renin ratios and asymmetrical curves obtained by renography had only a very limited predictive value. In experienced hands percutaneous transluminal arterial dilatation is relatively safe, and this study suggests that it should be attempted in all patients with renal artery stenosis. Only in patients with severe atheromatosis of the aorta should the risk associated with the catheterisation be weighed against the 50% or so chance of benefit from the procedure.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"renal artery stenosis\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"percutaneous transluminal arterial dilatation\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [\"arteriography\"], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

A 42-year-old man was admitted for a heart murmur and abnormal findings in the screening chest roentgenogram. Having no symptoms on admission, his physical activity was evaluated as Class I according to the classification of the New York Heart Association. A systolic murmur (Levine III/VI) with split second sound was audible at the left sternal border in the 3rd intercostal space. Chest roentgenogram revealed 57% of the cardio-thoracic ratio and no signs of increased pulmonary vascular markings. ECG showed incomplete right bundle branch block. Echocardiography and right ventriculography visualized the supravalvular membranous structured stenosed pulmonary artery 1cm above the pulmonic valve. Systolic pressure gradient between the right ventricle and the distal main pulmonary trunk was 54mmHg. The patient was diagnosed as having pulmonary supravalvular membranous stenosis. PTBD was applied using Inoue balloon catheter, where inflation was initiated from approximately 120% of pulmonary arterial diameter and terminated at 150%. This procedure decreased systolic pressure gradient from 54mmHg to 36mmHg without complication. After PTBD right ventriculography demonstrated that a part of the membranous structure had become floppy and movable. Pulmonary arterial diameter was unchanged. We considered that PTBD tore the membranous structure, which consequently resulted in the decrease of systolic pressure gradient. Systolic murmur diminished to Levine II/VI. Six months later, cardiac catheterization showed no change in systolic pressure gradient compared with that immediately after PTBD. This is the first report on pulmonary supravalvular membranous stenosis successfully treated with PTBD.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"pulmonary supravalvular membranous stenosis\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"percutaneous transluminal balloon dilatation\", \"CureRate\": \"1.0\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [\"chest roentgenogram,Echocardiography,right ventriculography\"], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

Thirteen patients (29%) survived 2 months or longer after dialysis treatment (\"survivors\"). Thirty-one patients (71%) died within this period (\"nonsurvivors\"). The main factor distinguishing survivors was the frequency of sepsis (none of 13 survivors vs 17 of 31 nonsurvivors). Preexisting malignancy and total number of acute insults to renal function were significantly less frequent, and immediate clinical and biochemical outcome of dialysis significantly better in survivors. The overall complication rate of dialysis was high (31 of 44 patients), but was significantly lower in survivors. Acute peritoneal dialysis is a useful procedure in the management of ARF in the elderly.

Therefore, valves of 24 CAPD patients (ages 55 +/- 11 years; CAPD duration: 29 +/- 28 months) were studied in a prospective echocardiographic and Doppler echocardiographic follow-up analysis over 35 months.

Eight patients benefited from this treatment.

After delivery she continued to have active TTP with thrombocytopenia which responded repeatedly to plasma infusion though their frequency gradually decreased to about one unit every 3-4 weeks. Three years after the birth of the first child she conceived again and was easily managed with repeated plasma infusions although the frequency and amount of plasma required to prevent thrombocytopenia were increased. She delivered a normal 3.4 kg term baby after which she again had a decreased plasma requirement. This is the first report of a woman with 5 years of active TTP managed with plasma alone. She experienced two pregnancies in which both mother and infant survived. We believe that the use of plasma in the management of TTP during pregnancy will improve the survival rate of both mother and infant. At the time of second birth, the platelet count was low in the mother but normal in the baby.

We conclude that CMA might be useful in the treatment of sleep apnea syndrome.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"sleep apnea syndrome\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"progesterone\", \"CureRate\": \"1.0\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

All had been treated by an extremely rigorous conservative regime in which the patients were kept in hospital for an average period of twenty-six months, during which time they were confined to bed with the legs in wide abduction, first in traction and later in \"broomstick\" plasters to ensure \"containment\" of the femoral head. The patients were assessed by the joint clincial and radiological method described by Ratliff (1956). The results were very satisfactory, with only 2 per cent poor results and 10 per cent fair. The remaining 88 per cent were good. The radiological results at the end of treatment have also been compared with control series described by Catterall (1972) and with the osteotomy series of Lloyd-Roberts, Catterall and Salamon (1976). From this it appears that the described regime offers no benefit compared with the natural history in Catterall's Groups I and II, and in Group III the results were only marginally better than those following osteotomy. In Group IV cases, however, where the femoral head was totally involved, the benefit was important, and since these are the cases which carry the worst natural prognosis it is suggested that the use of the method described in such instances must be seriously considered in spite of its social disadvantages. The theoretical implications of the findings are considered, and it is concluded that the benefits of the method cannot be ascribed wholly to the application of the \"containment\" principle.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"perthes' disease\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"prolonged recumbency and femoral head containment\", \"CureRate\": \"0.88\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

Langerhans' cell (LC) and T-cell were stained immunohistochemically on the specimens excised from the cervical cancer. In squamous cell carcinoma, 5-year survival rates for patients with LC infiltration were significantly better than those without LC (78% versus 60%; P &lt; 0.01). The 5-year survival rate of patients with T-cell infiltration also was significantly better than that of patients without such infiltration (83% versus 61%; P &lt; 0.05). Similar trends were observed in patients with adenocarcinoma; 5-year survival rates for patients with LC infiltration and those without LC infiltration were 49% and 25%, respectively (P &lt; 0.025). The survival rates for patients with T-cell infiltration and those without were 50% and 33%, respectively (P &lt; 0.1). An analysis of patterns of failure of radiation therapy demonstrated that the favorable prognosis in LC infiltration was attributable mainly to improvement of local control rates, but that in T-cell infiltration was not. T-cells infiltrated into tumor specifically in the patients with LC infiltration in both cell types. The authors suggest that the host anti-cancer immune response of individual patients may be remarkably different at the first step of antigen recognition by LC. The LC may induce T-cell-mediated antitumor response and improve local response in radiation therapy.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"cervical cancer\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"radiation therapy\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

The lesions treated were 49 epitheliomas of the esophageal opening, excluding hypopharyngeal tumors extending into the esophagus, and 15 epitheliomas of the remaining cervical segment of the esophagus. Survival did not exceed 2 years in any patient, and the reasons for these poor results are investigated. These included the particular selection of patients, the choice of radiotherapy as basic treatment, and the dosage administered. A new therapeutic approach is proposed based on pathologic findings and the various therapeutic measures available. Preoperative chemotherapy is followed by a total laryngopharyngectomy, with a total esophagectomy without opening the thorax and under certain well defined conditions. Continuity is re-established by a gastropharyngostomy, and postoperative radiotherapy is given routinely.

This report is confined to the 165 patients treated by radiation therapy (RT) only and focuses on the problem of relapse in the neck. A comparison is made between patients treated for the primary tumor with RT portals less than or equal to 30 cm2 and patients treated with larger field sizes. Sixty patients suffered a local recurrence, which was followed by a relapse in the neck in 13 patients. Nineteen patients experienced a relapse in the neck without a previous local failure. Five of these patients experienced a local failure at a later time. A multivariate analysis showed that the risk of a regional failure was significantly higher after a local failure and also for patients treated with small radiation portals (less than or equal to 30 cm2). Patients with an advanced tumor stage did not have a higher risk of a regional failure. A recurrence in the neck carried a poor survival; nearly two thirds of these patients died of their disease. As a recurrence in the neck seems to be correlated to the control of the primary tumor as well as to the (elective) treatment of the neck, best strategies to further increase the local/regional control are discussed.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"supraglottic larynx cancer\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"radiation therapy\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

We used flow cytometry in 30 patients with transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder who received pre-operative irradiation (40 Gy in 24 patients, 20 Gy in 5 patients and 60 Gy in one) with follow-up for at least 3 years. Total 140 paraffin embedded samples (4.6 samples per one patient) were available.

Eight DNA diploid tumors and twenty-two DNA aneuploid ones were detected before irradiation. Although diploid group didn't change its DNA ploidy after irradiation, of 22 aneuploid tumors 18 were changed to DNA diploid and 4 were not changed in their ploidy. 2. The tumor eradicating effect of irradiation was shown to be higher (p &lt; 0.05) in the diploid group (5 of 8, 63%) than in the aneuploid group (5 of 22, 23%). 3.

Evidence for favorable survival in patients with DNA diploid tumors.\nAbstract: Stage D1 disease is found in at least every sixth patient undergoing bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy and radical retropubic prostatectomy (RRP) for clinically localized prostate cancer (PC). Previous recommendations for monotherapy using surgery, radiation, or systemic therapy alone for Stage D1 disease have usually been associated with a poor outcome in regard to progression and survival. Unlike other pathologic stages, D1 disease treated with RRP is mainly related to DNA ploidy pattern in regard to all end points (progression and survival) and immediate adjuvant hormonal treatment (AHT) rather than to the usual pathologic variables, including the number of positive nodes. Complete DNA ploidy information was available in 370 patients with Stage D1 disease (age range, 40-77 years; mean, 64 years) undergoing RRP with or without AHT with a follow-up of up to 22 years (mean, 5 years). Overall, 80% of all DNA ploidy classes (diploid, 37%; tetraploid, 46%; and aneuploid, 17%) had AHT that highly significantly delayed progression for diploid (P less than 0.0001) more than tetraploid (P less than 0.0001) and more than aneuploid (P less than 0.0001) tumors. Significant prolongation of the disease-free interval might have improved the quality of life for tetraploid and aneuploid patients. Survival (crude and cause-specific) was significantly (P = 0.02) improved only for diploid patients who received AHT but not for tetraploid and aneuploid patients. This was due to the significantly accelerated death rate after progression in those patients with early AHT for tetraploid and aneuploid (but not diploid) tumors. Delayed (on progression only) AHT resulted in high progression rates for all DNA ploidy classes (aneuploid greater than tetraploid greater than diploid); e.g., 21 of 30 diploid patients progressed and 6 patients died from disease at a median of 31.5 months in spite of immediate hormone treatment on progression. RRP and AHT for patients with Stage D1 disease resulted in a highly significant delay in overall progression (76% at 10 years) and excellent local control, depending on DNA ploidy pattern (diploid greater than tetraploid greater than aneuploid) compared with a treatment regimen without AHT (24% overall nonprogression); only 20% of all patients with AHT are projected to die of disease at 10 years. Disease in diploid patients (37%) treated with AHT rarely progressed and those patients are unlikely to die of disease in 10 years or less; delayed (on progression) hormone treatment for diploid patients seemed ineffective. Inclusion of values for prostate specific antigen led to a higher failure rate on progression, and this is dependent on DNA ploidy class (diploid greater than tetraploid greater than aneuploid). Only patients with nondiploid tumors should be entered into prospective studies using innovative adjuvant treatment protocols to improve survival.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"prostate cancer\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"radical prostatectomy and adjuvant hormonal treatment\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

Following 40 Gy irradiation of the lower abdomen, treatment consisted of cystectomy or continued irradiation of the bladder region only. A full urological examination of the bladder established whether a patient was a responder or non-responder. The patients were divided into four groups: 27 responders treated with cystectomy and diversion; 48 responders treated with continued radiotherapy up to 65 Gy; 24 non-responders treated with cystectomy and diversion; 42 non-responders treated with continued radiotherapy up to 65 Gy. Survival and complications of treatment were compared with regard to category and grade of the tumours and sex and age of the patients. It was concluded that the responders who underwent cystectomy after 40 Gy irradiation survived longer than those who received a full course of radiotherapy. The responders had a better survival rate than non-responders, regardless of further treatment.

High doses, close to the maximum tolerable, were used with the shrinking field technique with no attempt at prophylactic whole neck irradiation. T1 and T2 cases represented 40% of the whole group and 40% of the patients presented clinically positive neck disease. This latter group had a significantly lower cure rate (42.8%) than the N0 patients (88.3%). Disease control depended also on the T stage: all 30 T1 and T2 lesions, 18/22 (81.8%) of the T3, and 6/17 (35.3%) of the T4 lesions were controlled. Cord fixation and early cartilage destruction were not a major obstacle for tumor control. Base of tongue involvement and especially the T4 and N3 association were indications of poor prognosis. Adenopathies smaller than 3 cm were controlled in 14/16 cases while nodes greater than or equal to 3 cm were controlled in 5/11 cases. Failures in neck nodes outside the treatment field were encountered in 7% of the cases but as the sole element of failure they represented 5.6%. Absolute survival at 3 years was 69.7% for the whole series while loco-regional control was 74.6%. No patient was salvaged by surgery. Three loco-regional recurrences occurred 3 years after the treatment. Although no lethal complications were encountered severe late reactions were noted in about 20% of the patients with controlled primary lesion, requiring tracheostomy in 4 cases (7%). Treatment guidelines are suggested: T1, T2, &amp; T3 lesions associated with adenopathy smaller than 3 cm should be treated by radiotherapy. Limited extra laryngeal extension especially to cartilage can still be controlled by irradiation. More advanced cases, especially the subcategory of T4 N3 patients, should have a multidisciplinary approach. After high doses of irradiation only limited surgery is permissible.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"cancer of the supraglottic larynx\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"radiotherapy\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

The present prospective study was to determine the influence of previous radiotherapy, widely used in the management of this tumour, on the accuracy of endosonography. A complete endosonographic examination was performed just before surgery in 40 patients with rectal cancer. Endosonographic and pathological staging were compared in group A, 21 patients without previous radiotherapy, and group B, 19 patients with preoperative radiotherapy. While the endosonographic accuracy for lymph node involvement was similar in the two groups (85 per cent compared with 84 per cent), wall invasion was correctly ascertained in 86 per cent in group A but in only 47 per cent in group B (P less than 0.05). After irradiation, the thickening of the rectal wall and the poor visualization of the hyperechoic layers hampered interpretation. Post-radiotherapy inflammation and/or fibrosis probably explained the echographic changes. Radiotherapy therefore altered endosonographic staging of rectal cancer.

All patients underwent radiation treatment only. In the series 32 patients were state 1 and 68 stage 2. About 1/2 had undifferentiated squamous epithelioma and the others moderately differentiated epthelioma. Radiotherapy consisted of intracavity radium of 5000 mg-hr. and an external telecobalt irradiation up to 4000 rad tumor dose through 4 portals. During and after radiotherapy patients were followed by clinical examiniations and vaginal smears. Months after beginning of treatment another cervical punch biopsy was done. The 3 year recovery rate was 97% of stage 1 but only 75% of stage 2 patients. Recovery seemed better in well differentiated epithelioma and in cases treated first with external radiation. There were 13 deaths from recurrent disease within 5 to 35 months after begining of treatment. Punch biopsies performed 4 months after beginning of treatment revealed carcinomatous tissue in the cervical area of only 2 of these 13 patients. In all 87 survivors, abnormal cells disappeared from vaginal smears by 7 weeks. In the 13 fatal cases, abnormal cells persisted for 7 weeks or beyond. In 5 of the 13 fatal cases, tumor cells in the vaginal smears persisted throughout the remainder of the patients' lives. Other follow-up methods seemed inefficient cases. Well defined vaginal cytology seemed of most prognostic value.

Thirteen infants were admitted within 30 hours of delivery, and the remainder at 2 to 3 weeks of age. Infants were rewarmed under a radiant warmer. The mean time required to reach a rectal temperature of 36.5 degrees C was 3.96 +/- 2.37 hours. Major medical entities encountered included thrombocytopenia (eight patients), metabolic acidosis (eight), respiratory distress (eight), renal failure (six), apnea (four), patent ductus arteriosus (four), seizures (four), intracranial hemorrhage (three), infection (three), and necrotizing enterocolitis (two). No complications could be attributed to the rapid rewarming technique. Of three infants who died, all weighed less than 1.25 kg at birth.

All eight patients demonstrated a continuous rise in the absolute number of neutrophils, eosinophils, and monocytes over the first four weeks of therapy. Bone marrow examination revealed a progressive increase in bone marrow cellularity in all patients except one. An increase in myeloid: erythroid ratio was seen with progressive maturation of granulocytic cells. Neutrophilic and eosinophilic myelocytes were the most prominent cells. The percentage of myeloblasts and promyelocytes did not increase significantly, and the proportions of postmitotic granulocytic cells did not change either. No significant morphologic changes were noted in the basophilic, erythroid, and megakaryocytic series. The most prominent topographic observation in the bone marrow during GM-CSF therapy was the frequent clustering of myeloid cells close to the bone trabeculae. The periosteal localization of myeloid precursors may reflect a higher concentration of stem cells and/or stromal cells in the bone marrow adjacent to the bone trabeculae or a higher concentration of growth factors. Careful morphologic examination of bone marrow in CSF clinical trials will provide useful information regarding the in vivo effects of these growth factors, and will aid in the development of a rational approach to combining them for therapy.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"refractory aplastic anemia\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"recombinant granulocyte macrophage-colony-stimulating factor\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [\"bone marrow examination\"], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

Apropos of 2 cases treated by direct reconstruction.\nAbstract: The authors present two cases of hepatic echinococcus cyst with destruction of the biliary confluent. The severity of this exceptional lesion requires uncommon treatment. Experience with treatment of biliary fistulas when there is a residual cystic cavity, provides arguments for and against primary suture of these fistulas. In these cases, the required treatment consists in reconstruction of the hepatic biliary ducts destroyed (right, left and common) by using the pericystic envelope itself as a plastic neoformative element. The result has demonstrated its efficacy after many years of use, as we have indicated in this article. \"Echinococcus granulosus\" itself is only rarely a problem in the host, but a hepatic echinococcus cyst does not only pose a spatial problem, except insofar as it often involves the biliary tree. In the cases reported here, the hepatic echinococcus cyst causes biliary problems in over 60% of the cases (1). These biliary problems were as follows: Compression of the common bile duct by the cys; More often, compression of the intrahepatic bile ducts causes the cyst to open inside the biliary duct and to fissure, leading to a biliocystic fistula.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"hepatic hydatid cyst\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"reconstruction\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

During the last 3 years, 11 cases of lung cancer with chest wall involvement have been encountered at the Jackson Veterans Administration Medical Center. We reviewed these cases to reassess the role of concomitant resection of the lung and chest wall. From this experience, we have concluded that (1) chest wall involvement is potentially curable; (2) chest wall resection adds little if any morbidity to the procedure; (3) resections of fewer than four ribs usually require only soft tissue coverage, without a prosthesis; (4) patients with squamous cell cancer have longer survival; (5) chest wall resection is highly effective in the relief of pain due to invasion of the chest wall; and (6) survival is greater than in other stage III lung carcinomas and is more closely related to nodal involvement than to chest wall invasion.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"bronchogenic carcinoma\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"resection of lung and chest wall\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

In fact, while the air released by the alveolar baro-trauma can, once a given pressure is exceeded, migrate into the retroperitoneum and produce a non-surgical pneumascos (for which the other possible causes are far more exceptional, and rather are unpleasant surprises, such as this orogenital induced PPT in Gantt's female patient, conversely the pressurized air from true ruptures of intraabdominal hollow organs may migrate into the mediastinum and cause a thoracic air leakage syndrome that perfectly simulates this pulmonary baro-trauma. Therefore all the paraclinical means required must be used to confirm--or rule out--this diagnosis of perforation, which demands emergency surgery. However, if there is any doubt, the consensus is that emergency surgery is recommended as it is better to accept blank laparotomy than to oversee a gastrointestinal rupture with all its severe complications of evolution.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"severe blunt injuries\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"respiratory or cardiorespiratory resuscitation\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

Proliferation of the cells was triggered by medium conditioned by acute myelocytic leukemic cells exposed to 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol 13-acetate (TPA). The medium was designated as TPA-treated cell conditioned medium (TPACCM). The cycle of events in fetal bone marrow cell culture began with a sharp decrease in the total number of cells. At this juncture a predominance of primitive macrophage-like cells positive for macrophage markers was present in the culture. The process of multiplication began with rapid proliferation of promyelocytes. Simultaneous proliferation of granulocyte-macrophage (GM) colony forming cells (CFC) indicated that at least some of the promyelocytes might act like CFC. The absolute number of committed CFC then increased 5-11 fold, the number that approximated a total multiplication of FBM cells. The proliferation continued with the culture containing some blast cells and showing simultaneous differentiation of the cells into mature granulocytes and macrophages. The cells with macrophage markers persisted throughout the culture period. To determine more precise definition of the role of primitive macrophages and promyelocytes in FBM cell multiplication, experiments with purified fractions of these cells have to be done. TPACCM purification and isolation of active substances is also suggested. These investigations might result in obtaining a pool of BM cells in vitro suitable for BM transplantation.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol 13-acetate (TPA)\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

The only problem concerns the type of pitressin to be used. In the past, pitressin snuff and various other intranasal instillations have been used, but these either have not been very effective, or have resulted in unpleasant side effects such as rhinitis. Until recently, the only effective form of the drug available in Australia has been pitressin tannate in oil. This often has to be given as a daily injection, which, like all intramuscular injections, is painful and, being in an oily base, is particularly likely to result in abscess formation.

Concentrations of FU varied widely in many patients. Concentration of drug X time of infusion (C X t values) were calculated. Patients showing a partial response or stabilization of disease had significantly higher C X t values than non-responders. Methyl CCNU did not affect the C X t values of FU.

Cyst volume was quantified both geometrically and isotopically with 99Tc, values differing by 7%. Dosimetry was determined by applying the formula developed by Loevinger et al., and 20,000 rads were administered throughout to the cystic wall. All 17 patients, except for 4 children, had previously received surgery, shunts or radiotherapy, alone or combined. In 4 cases, 90Y injection was the only treatment, while in 6, the cyst was evacuated at 10 days following radiocolloid injection. Skull and spinal column gamma chamber studies were carried out on all patients at 24, 48, and 72 hours post injection, but no isotope leakage could be detected. The patients returned to normal activities except one with multiple cysts who died. There were no changes in the endocrinologic profile. In one case, a decrease in visual acuity 18 months after treatment, improved following corticoid administration.

VP-16-213 was given on relapse. Response rate and survival were analyzed according to extent of tumor, presence of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone production (SIADH), and, in 38 patients, size of intrathoracic tumor as measured by computerized tomographic (CT) scanning. The median survival of the entire group was 34.6 weeks. In patients with limited disease the median survival was 46 weeks compared to 29 weeks for those with extensive disease. This difference in survival between patients with limited and extensive disease was most marked in those showing a partial response (median survival, 45.9 and 28 weeks, respectively). Patients with ectopic antidiuretic hormone production had a poor prognosis even if they had achieved a complete response. Only one partial response to VP-16-213 occurred. There was a strong correlation between initial intrathoracic tumor size as assessed by total cross-sectional area on CT scan and response and survival. When the total area exceeded 30 cm2 there were no complete responders, but there were complete responses in eight of 21 patients when the area was less than 30 cm2. The relationship between intrathoracic tumor size and response rate was present when analyzed according to disease extent, age, sex, and performance status. A clear relationship between total tumor area and survival was also found. When SCCB is treated with chemotherapy alone, the prognosis is better for those patients who present with limited disease, without SIADH, and with small intrathoracic tumor. In this group it is possible that further intensification of therapy may result in prolonged survival.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"small cell carcinoma of the bronchus\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"a combination of cyclophosphamide, methotrexate with calcium leucovorin rescue, and lomustine (CCNU).\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

The hearing gain from adenoidectomy alone was similar to that resulting from insertion of a grommet alone, but the children having adenoidectomy required fewer reinsertions to maintain adequate subjective hearing thresholds in the treated ear (26% versus 54%). Tonsillectomy conferred no additional benefit.

Twenty-two were infected and 21 were refractory to random platelet transfusions at the time of admission. All were given marrow grafts from HLA-identical siblings. Forty-five were conditioned for grafting by cyclophosphamide (CY), 50 mg/kg on each of 4 successive days, and four by 1000 rad total body irradiation. All were given intermittent methotrexate therapy within the first 100 days of grafting to modify graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Three patients died from infection too early to evaluate (days 1-8). Forty-six had marrow engraftment. Of these, 20 are surviving with good peripheral blood counts between 186 and 999 days, and 18 have returned to normal activities. Chronic GCHD is a problem in five. Twelve patients died of infection following rejection of the marrow graft. Twelve patients died with bacterial or fungal infections or interstitial pneumonia and active GVHD or soon following resolution of GVHD. Two patients died with marrow engraftment and no GVHD, one with an interstitial, and the other with a bacterial pneumonia. Thirty-six patients who had received random donor blood transfusions were randomly assigned to receive either CY or procarbazine-antithymocyte globulin-CY as conditioning regimens to test whether the incidence of graft rejection could be decreased. There was no difference in the incidence of graft rejection between the two regimens.

The goals of the combined procedure were to increase correction of the curve and decrease the rate of pseudarthrosis. Preoperatively, the major curves measured an average of 83 degrees, and on the best side-bend they averaged 59 degrees, a 29 per cent degree of flexibility. At the time of discharge from the hospital the curves had improved to an average of 44 degrees, a correction of the preoperative curve of 39 degrees or 47 per cent. At an average length of follow-up of forty-nine months, the major curves measured an average of 50 degrees, a 41 per cent correction compared with the initial curves. Twenty-three of the major curves were better than when they were measured on the preoperative radiograph of the best side-bend, by an average of 15 degrees, but eight curves were either the same or worse. No patient had pseudarthrosis or permanent neurological injury. It is our conclusion that a two-stage anterior and posterior fusion is of value for the treatment of the adult who has a rigid curve that requires maximum correction to allow the head, shoulders, and torso to be centered over the pelvis.

We studied the progression of the kyphosis and evaluated the function and fate of the bone grafts that were used. At eight years, the results with respect to the progression of the kyphosis were classified as excellent or good in forty-eight patients (59 per cent), all of whom had had minimum destruction of the vertebral bodies; limited surgical excision of bone, resulting in a small post-debridement defect that needed only a short graft; marked intraoperative correction of the deformity; and involvement of lower lumbar segments. Fifteen patients (19 per cent) had a fair result and eighteen (22 per cent), a poor result. An increase in the deformity was common in patients who had extensive involvement of the vertebral bodies that had resulted in a large post-debridement defect necessitating a graft spanning more than two disc spaces. Lesions of the thoracic vertebrae were associated with many of the poor results, and patients who had a marked kyphosis before treatment also did not do well. A stable graft that provided structural support was observed in only thirty-three patients (41 per cent), and failure of the graft due to slippage, fracture, absorption, or subsidence was seen in forty-eight patients (59 per cent). The length of the graft also played a role: the graft failed most often in patients in whom it spanned more than two disc spaces. We concluded that it is unwise to rely solely on the graft to prevent vertebral collapse in patients in whom the length of the graft exceeds two disc spaces. These patients may benefit from additional measures, such as an extended period of non-weight-bearing, posterior arthrodesis after six to twelve weeks, and prolonged use of a brace until complete consolidation is evident.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"tuberculosis of the spine\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"anterior arthrodesis\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

Successful results were noted in 792 ureteric units; in 10 cases of post-operative stenosis and 17 cases of recurrent VUR a second AUVB was performed. The following causes of operative failure were found: obstruction of the submucosal ureter after tailoring (5 cases), stricture of the new ureteric orifice (3), necrosis of the terminal part of the ureter (2), submucosal ureter too short or too wide (12) and fibrosis of the detrusor muscle over the submucosal ureter (5); a success rate of 84% was noted after the second procedure.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"primary vesicoureteric reflux\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"antireflux ureterocystostomy\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

One hundred and eleven cases completed the whole course of study, and only one failed to be followed up. The results of the follow-up for 12 mon showed that the remission rate was 41.4% (46/111) and relapse rate was 58.6% (65/111). The present study indicated that the remission or relapse was related with serum levels of T3 before treatment, shrank goiter and disappearance of goiter bruit during the treatment as well as thyroid suppression rate, but not related to sex, age, period of illness before therapy or severity of the disease. It is suggested that a 6-mon antithyroid drug therapy instead of traditional long term therapy may be suitable for those patients who are with a reduced goiter and disappeared goiter bruit during the antithyroid therapy, and suppressible thyroid up-take by T3 and whose serum levels of T3 before treatment are not very high.

Two vertebral bodies were affected in 82 patients, one in 23 cases, more than 4 in 70 patients. Sixty-one patients had neural involvement at the time of admission, 42 of them an incomplete or complete paraplegia. All patients were treated by triple-drug chemotherapy. Chemotherapy and bed rest alone was sufficient for 76 patients. Surgical intervention was indicated in 132 cases. Debridement was carried out in 33 cases, debridement and spinal fusion was performed in 18 cases, anterolateral decompression of the spinal cord alone was employed in 15 cases, and together with spinal fusion recommended in 15 cases. Minor surgical procedures were made necessary in 8 cases. The indications for surgery were: (1) unfavorable response to conservative treatment during 3 months, (2) Pott's paraplegia showing no signs of recovery by conservative treatment, (3) Pott's paraplegia developing during conservative treatment (4) cases with unstable spinal lesions, and (5) cases with paravertebral abscesses and sinuses. Complete or good recovery occurred in 61 out of 76 conservatively treated patients. Forty-two out of 61 patients with neural involvement made a complete or a good recovery, 31 being patients with paraplegia. No improvement was noted in 16 cases with neural involvement, and 2 had progression of the neurological signs. A complete recovery was noted in 101 out of 132 operatively treated patients, a good recovery in 21, and no improvement in 9 patients with paraplegia. One patient died; 141 patients returned to their former work, 30 of whom were recovered paraplegics. Fifteen had retired because of advanced age. Modern treatment begins with triple-drug chemotherapy and bed rest for 3 months. If the response is unsatisfactory, debridement or debridement with spinal fusion is carried out as soon as possible. Anterolateral decompression is applied in cases with paraplegia.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"spinal tuberculosis\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"antituberculous chemotherapy and radical operation\", \"CureRate\": \"0.48\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

She had no history of trauma to the calf, and family history was negative for muscle disease. Physical examination showed an enlarged left calf muscle with pain which was evoked by stretching of the Achilles tendon. There was no muscle weakness or neurological abnormality. Laboratory tests were all within normal limits, including erythrocyte sedimentation rate and serum enzymes such as creatine kinase and aldolase. The CT scan revealed an isolated round-shaped low density area in the left calf muscle, which showed up as a markedly high signal intensity on T2 weighted images of MRI. The lesion was confirmed to be the lateral head of the gastrocnemius muscle. The specimen obtained from the affected muscle demonstrated degenerative and inflammatory changes together with excess fibrosis. There was no sarcoid lesion or malignancy. From the above results, the present case was thought to have isolated focal myositis. Prednisolone 80 mg (40 mg, twice, at 4-day intervals) was given to the left femoral artery without any trouble. Thereafter the patient became free from pain and difficulty in walking, and the lesion demonstrated by CT scan disappeared in 15 days. However, the high signal intensity on T2 weighted images faintly remained until the 54th day after the treatment.

A total of 25 patients received combined treatment with bacillus Calmette-Guerin and interleukin-2 at weekly instillations for 6 consecutive weeks and then monthly for 1 year. T antigen expression in all patients was studied before treatment. Of the patients 16 had positive T antigen expression in the tumors: 13 (81%) remained free of tumor for an average of 28 months, 3 had a noninvasive recurrence each at 8 to 27 months (mean 18 months) and all responded well to a repeated treatment cycle. Nine patients were negative for T antigen: 1 (11%) remained free of tumor for 11 months, while 8 had recurrence within 12 months. Of the latter 8 patients 2 had noninvasive recurrence each at 4 to 5 months but they responded to a repeated treatment cycle and remained free of tumor for 4 to 22 months (mean 13 months), 4 had subsequent repeated recurrences at 12 to 41 months (mean 22 months) and 2 had progression to deep invasion resulting in cystectomy at 11 to 12 months. Thus, the disease-free rate (continuous complete response) in patients with tumors positive for T antigen was 81%, while that in patients with tumors negative for T antigen was 11% (p less than 0.005, chi-square test). The over-all response rate in patients with positive and negative tumors to bacillus Calmette-Guerin and interleukin-2 treatment was 100 and 33%, respectively, and that for the total patients was 76%.

Importance of haemodynamic parameters before and after dilatation.\nAbstract: Early and late prognosis after percutaneous balloon aortic valvuloplasty (PBAV) was assessed in 38 consecutive elderly patients (mean age, 78.5 +/- 6.1 years). Significant valve opening was achieved in 35 patients. The hospital mortality was 8% (three patients); two other patients died within the first month and three underwent aortic valve replacement. At 2 years follow-up, there were 10 additional deaths (seven cardiac deaths) and five patients had symptom recurrence managed by aortic valve replacement (3) or repeat PBAV (2). Overall, six patients underwent surgery without untoward events and six had repeat PBAV. Only two out of six patients with repeat PBAV had sustained improvement; one was referred to surgery and the remaining three died soon after the second PBAV. One- and 2-year survival were respectively 72 and 62% and percentage of survivors with persistent improvement 68 and 41%. Although aortic valve area after PBAV was associated with outcome, predictors of poor long-term prognosis were primarily related to the pre-operative haemodynamic status.

The patient was successfully treated with a left superficial temporal artery to middle cerebral artery bypass followed by balloon entrapment of the aneurysm. There have been at least 40 previously reported cases of aneurysms of the petrous portion of the carotid artery. These aneurysms can be mycotic, traumatic, or developmental in origin. They can present with massive otorrhagia or epistaxis from acute rupture or with decreased hearing and paresis of the fifth through eighth cranial nerves and, less frequently, of the ninth, 10th, and 12th cranial nerves caused by direct pressure. They can also produce pulsatile tinnitus, and sometimes they are discovered as a retrotympanic vascular mass during otological examination. The treatment of choice is carotid artery occlusion. Trapping of the aneurysm by detachable balloons eliminates immediately the risk of hemorrhage, offers the possibility of test occlusion of the internal carotid artery with the patient awake prior to permanent occlusion, and should also reduce the risk of thromboembolism. It should be preceded by a bypass procedure when preliminary evaluation indicates that the patient will not tolerate internal carotid artery occlusion.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"aneurysm of the ica petrous segment\", \"Symptoms\": [\"horizontal diplopia\", \"hemifacial numbness\"], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"balloon entrapment after EC-IC bypass\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [\"arteriography\"], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

This technique has not been previously reported for treatment of dissection. Review of 34 published reports of symptomatic intimal dissection associated with non-penetrating trauma to the head and neck revealed that most did not have a direct injury to the carotid region and that development of symptoms was often delayed. Only 50% of these patients had onset of neurological symptoms within six hours of the episode of trauma, while 33% remained asymptomatic for more than one week before complications occurred. In 15 patients who were treated surgically, only nine (60%) achieved full recovery. Operative repair was considered unduly hazardous in our patient because of extension of the spiral dissection to the base of the skull.

In spite of the use of syngeneic bone marrow, failure of engraftment occurred on two occasions. In vitro studies demonstrated that natural killer (NK) cells from the recipient markedly inhibited the growth of donor bone marrow granulocyte progenitor cells.

Apropos of a case treated by OKT3 monoclonal antibodies for an acute graft versus host reaction.\nAbstract: The incidence of malignant lymphoma after bone marrow transplant seems very low. A 31 years old patient was treated with allogeneic bone marrow transplantation for chronic myeloid leukemia; she develops 12 days after grafting a severe graft-versus-host disease (GVH) refractory to treatment with steroids and Cyclosporin A. The GVH was then treated with an anti-T lymphocyte monoclonal antibody (OKT3). The disease responded dramatically to this treatment but the GVH reappeared immediately at the end of OKT3 therapy and the patient died the 103th day after grafting. The autopsy revealed extensive lymphoid infiltrate by a monoclonal IgM K immunoblastic proliferation. After organ or bone marrow transplant, a wide spectrum of lymphoid lesions can be observed, ranging from follicular or diffuse polyclonal hyperplasia to monoclonal immunoblastic lymphoma. The criteria for monoclonality are discussed.

We studied the natural history of esophageal stricture in 154 patients in whom bougienage was used as primary therapy. Dilatations were considered successful in terms of relief or major improvement of dysphagia in 84.5% of 103 patients followed 6 mo or longer (median, 26 mo). The risk of requiring esophageal dilatation after the initial episode was greatest in the first year of follow-up; thereafter, a smaller fraction of patients required dilatation each year. Forty-three percent of patients required no further dilatations, and a life-table analysis showed that 36% of patients would require no further dilatation during a projected 4-yr follow-up. The median frequency of subsequent dilatation was less than once a year. We were unable to identify any significant factors, such as initial severity of stricture, cause of stricture, presence of active esophagitis, or initial caliber of dilatation, that could predict the need for subsequent dilatation. Our results suggest that patients with benign strictures fall into two groups. In one group, the natural history was to improve or become asymptomatic after an initial series of dilatations, and only a small proportion eventually developed recurrent symptoms. The second group (46% of patients) required further dilatations to treat dysphagia during the first year of follow-up. Two-thirds of these patients needed regular dilatations in subsequent years.

Besides the clinical data related to prostatism, prostatic volume was studied in 4 of the 5 patients by means of transrectal ultrasonography. All 5 patients showed a marked decrease of prostatic volume, which averaged 31.4% (range 19-55%) after 2-3 months. This correlated well with a relief of urinary obstruction.

We studied the efficacy and safety of catheter ablation in treating these patients. Six patients with the diagnosis of PJRT were treated at our institution with direct-current catheter ablation. The study cohort comprised three men and three women with a mean age of 33.8 +/- 4.5 years. The mean time from onset of symptoms to ablation was 129 +/- 44.7 months. All failed multiple drug therapy (mean number of drugs failed was 5.3 +/- 0.5). The left ventricular ejection fractions were calculated by echocardiography and were greater than 60% in all except two patients, whose ejection fractions were 25% and 32%. Symptom duration was significantly longer in those with depressed ejection fraction compared with normal patients (258 versus 64.5 months, p less than 0.01). Electrophysiological findings revealed evidence of an atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia involving retrograde decremental conduction over an accessory pathway localized to the posteroseptal area. Five patients received two direct-current shocks (250 +/- 16.7 J per shock) via paired electrodes from a catheter positioned just outside the coronary sinus os to a patch placed between the scapulae or on the anterior chest wall. One patient received a single direct-current shock of 300 J. The only complication was the development of complete atrioventricular block in one patient. This patient had previously undergone permanent pacemaker insertion for the sick sinus syndrome. The mean hospital stay after ablation was 2.2 days. Mean peak creatinine phosphokinase after ablation was 352 +/- 58.1 units/l and the MB fraction was 12 +/- 2%. Follow-up echocardiograms or gated nuclear studies showed improvement of ejection fraction in the two patients who presented with depressed ejection fractions. After a mean follow-up of 35.8 +/- 10.3 months, all patients remained free of tachycardia without antiarrhythmic drugs. We conclude that catheter ablation by using direct current energy appears to be an effective treatment in patients with PJRT.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"junctional reciprocating tachycardia\", \"Symptoms\": [\"narrow-complex tachycardia\"], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"catheter ablation\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

Three patients underwent transcatheter oily chemoembolization (TOCE) (7 courses), and one received intraarterial iodized oil with chemotherapeutic drug after surgical intraarterial catheter placement (1 course).

All patients were treated by CAVHD using Hospal AN69S 0.43 m2 filters and Fresenius 1.5% peritoneal dialysis fluid at dialysate flow rates (Qd) of 1 and 2 l/h. Patients received cefuroxime 500 mg (n = 11) or 750 mg (n = 1), or ceftazidime 500 mg (n = 9) i.v. 12-hourly and all studies were done at steady-state. For cefuroxime, volume of distribution (Vdarea) was 22.8 +/- 3.5 l, terminal elimination half-life (t1/2) 12.6 +/- 2.2 h and total body clearance (TBC) 22.3 +/- 3.0 ml/min (mean +/- SEM). Mean sieving coefficient (SC) was 0.90 +/- 0.12 and filter clearances at Qd 1 and 2 l/h were 14.0 +/- 2.3 and 16.2 +/- 3.4 ml/min respectively.

Apropos of 20 case reports.\nAbstract: Between 1966 and 1986, 27 tumors of the ampulla of Vater were operated on and 20 patients underwent potentially curative pancreatico-duodenal resection (PDR) (74% of resecability). The retrospective study of those 20 cases (13 men, 7 women, mean age: 59.9 +/- 9.8 years old) was done to evaluate the risks and the results of this type of wide resection. 15 patients (75%) had jaundice and gallbladder was palpable among 20 p. cent (4 cases) of the patients without cholecystectomy. Endoscopy was performed in 13 cases; endoscopic biopsies, done in 12 cases, were positive in 5 cases (45.4%), uncertain in three (25%) and falsely negative in four (33.3%). All the patients underwent Child's procedure. Histological analysis pointed out 15 adenocarcinomas and 5 malignant villous tumors; lymph node involvement was present in 11.1 p. cent; the staging following Martin's classification listed 6 stage 1, 3 stage II, 10 stage III and 1 stage IV. Operative mortality was of 5 p. cent; one patient died after an emergency procedure performed for massive bleeding but no death was observed in the group of patients treated out of emergency.

The rate of CR was 52%. Maintenance therapy was very simple and the only association with stanozolol during this period suggested to us that an androgen, at low dosages, might be responsible for the unusual long-term survival time (45 months with a 95% confidence limit from 30 to 86 months). On the basis of our first observation, high dosages of the androgen were used during the induction phase of treatment but failed to demonstrate any advantage when associated with a drug regimen, including cytosine arabinoside (ARA-C).

No variations of such activity observed in patients without therapeutic response or with minor response could be considered as a marker of primary or acquired resistance to chemotherapy.

All patients were given a marrow graft from an HLA-identical sibling after receiving 1000-rad total body irradiation (TBI). One group of 43 patients was given cyclophosphamide (CY), 60 mg/kg on each of 2 days, 5 and 4 days before TBI. In a second group of 31 patients, additional chemotherapy was given before CY and TBI. In a third group of 19 patients, BCNU was given before CY and TBI. A fourth group of 7 patients received other chemotherapy regimens before TBI. Six patients died 3-17 days after marrow infusion without evidence of engraftment. Ninety-four patients were engrafted and only one patient rejected the graft. Thirteen patients are alive with a marrow graft, on no maintenance antileukemic therapy, and without recurrent leukemia 1-4 1/2 yr after transplantation. Three have chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Four patients are alive 1 1/2 - 3 1/2 yr after grafting but have had a relapse of their leukemia. Of 93 evaluable patients, 19 did not develop GVHD and 24 developed very mild GVHD. Fifty patients developed moderate to severe GVHD, and 40 of these were treated with antithymocyte globulin. Interstitial pneumonia occurred in 54 patients and was the primary cause of death in 34. Interstitial pneumonia often occurred in association with GVHD and the most common etiologic agent was cytomegalovirus. A total of 31 patients have had a relapse of leukemia. There was no definite correlation between relapse of leukemia and the presence or absence of GVHD. The relapse rate appeared to be relatively constant over the first 2 yr and was extremely low after that time. Neither survival nor leukemic relapse appeared to be influenced by the type of leukemia nor by the preparative chemotherapy regimen given before TBI. Patients in fair clinical condition at the time of transplantation showed significantly longer survival times than patients in poor condition (p = 0.001). This observation, coupled with the observation that some patients may be cured of their disease, indicates that marrow transplantation should now be undertaken earlier in the management of patients with acute leukemia who have an HLA-matched sibling marrow donor.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"acute leukemia\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"chemotherapy, total body irradiation and allogeneic marrow transplantation\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

The first group of 10 patients were given marrow grafts at the time of leukemic relapse and the second group of six patients were given the grafts in the period of remission of their disease. For the first group (ALL/ANLL 2:8, age (median) 33, M/F 8:2), HLA-identical donor cells (25 x 10(7)/kg [median]) were infused after the patients were conditioned with NSC D 245382 (ACNU) or daunorubicin, cyclophosphamide (CY) and a single shot of 1000 rad of TBI. For the second group (ALL/ANLL 4:2, age (median) 20, M/F 5:1), HLA-identical donor cells (22 x 10(7)/kg [median]) were infused after the patients were conditioned with CY and fractionated (250 rad x 4) TBI. All the patients were isolated in a laminar air flow room (LAF) after gut and skin decontamination. Engraftment of donor cells was confirmed in 15 out of the 16 patients. Febrile periods in LAF and the days required for platelet transfusion were prolonged in the first group. All the patients in the first group died within 12-214 days after BMT because of interstitial pneumonitis (7 patients) or bacterial infection (3 patients). On the other hand, five out of six patients in the second group are alive 84-540 days after BMT. For the surviving patients, the complications of chronic graft versus host disease, viral infections, tuberculosis, hepatitis, hemorrhagic cystitis and recurrence of leukemia are now the problems. It can be stated that the patient's clinical condition at the time of BMT is one of the most essential factors for the success of BMT although the effects of other variables, such a change in the conditioning regimens of the supportive care, must also be carefully analyzed.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"acute leukemia\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"chemotherapy, total body irradiation and allogeneic marrow transplantation\", \"CureRate\": \"0.31\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [\"medical history,clinical imaging findings,serum antibody titer\"], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

Long-term outcome.\nAbstract: The authors have operated on 284 simple fractures, complicated by 12 post-operative infections (4.2 per cent) and 43 compound fractures, complicated by four infections (9.3 per cent). All the fractures were treated by plating. Thirteen of the infected cases have received long-term follow-up - ten after simple fractures and three after compound fractures. Nine out of the ten cases following simple fractures have healed, eight retaining the plate until consolidation and two being considered as infected non-unions. One of these two healed secondarily after fresh fixation and the other is still draining after a second operation, but has united. Two out of the four cases following compound fractures have already healed. The two others were considered as infected non-union and healed after fresh fixation. It is concluded that infection after fracture of the femoral shaft is a serious complication, but healing can be obtained in almost all cases.

Eighty-four episodes of peritonitis occurred., i.e one episode every 9.9 months of treatment. Since staphylococci accounted for 58% of the germs identified, intraperitoneal therapy with a penicillin M was instituted while dialysis was continued through chambers. Cure was obtained in 85.7% of all episodes, either with the penicillin M alone (57% of the cases) or after adjustment of the antibiotic therapy to bacteriological results (28.6% of the cases). Dialysis was discontinued in 10 patients (18%) on account of the peritonitis. The duration of hospital stay for peritonitis was 3.6 days per patient per year. These results were compared with those obtained by other groups. The advantages of penicillin M are its ease of administration, its narrow spectrum and high activity against the pathogens most commonly encountered, and its very low toxicity.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"peritonitis\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis\", \"CureRate\": \"0.857\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

To determine whether iron overload leads to insulin resistance before the development of insulin deficiency, insulin was infused (by euglycemic insulin-clamp technique) into 12 children with thalassemia (4 of whom were prepubertal, and 8 pubertal) who had normal or only moderately impaired glucose tolerance and who were receiving chelation therapy. Although insulin-stimulated glucose metabolism in the prepubertal children with thalassemia was similar to that in controls (normal prepubertal children) (319 +/- 23 vs. 314 +/- 41 mg per square meter of body-surface area per minute, P not significant), the response to insulin was markedly impaired in the pubertal children with thalassemia (155 +/- 18 vs. 224 +/- 15 mg per square meter per minute in normal pubertal controls, P less than 0.01). Plasma insulin levels rose excessively after oral glucose administration in the pubertal subjects with thalassemia, but not in the prepubertal patients (P less than 0.001). Furthermore, in response to a standard hyperglycemic stimulus, insulin levels in the pubertal patients rose to two to three times greater than normal and C-peptide levels became significantly elevated.

There were no significant differences in either the follicular phase or luteal phase hormonal profiles of estradiol and progesterone, but there was a significantly reduced pregnancy rate in those women with severe endometriosis. In part, this was due to the recovery of fewer oocytes from the endometriosis patients (P less than 0.001) despite the fact that the peak estradiol levels and ovarian accessibility were similar in the two groups. However, there were no significant differences in the proportion of oocytes that fertilized or the number that demonstrated normal embryo growth and high-grade embryo quality. There also appears to be an implantation inhibitory factor in patients with severe endometriosis as the pregnancy rate/embryo transferred and number of gestational sacs identified/embryo transferred were significantly reduced (P less than 0.05).\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"severe endometriosis\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

Four cases are described in which holding a retarded, ruminating child for 10-15 min before, during, and after meals, was associated with remission of rumination. Simple holding was effective in three; in the fourth, it was necessary to punish the child by putting her into a separate room for 3 min immediately after regurgitation. A within-subject reversal experimental design suggested that holding and not simple distraction was the effective component of the treatment. Treatment benefits were well maintained when the child returned to a home environment in which he or she continued to be held periodically. It is proposed that there are two behavioral etiologies for idiopathic rumination syndrome--social deprivation and reward learning through increased attention for regurgitation. Holding is the treatment of choice for the first type, and punishment with time out may be necessary to suppress regurgitation in the second type.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"rumination syndrome\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"increased holding\", \"CureRate\": \"0.75\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

These complexes have been used to treat Dpt-hypersensitive patients who suffered from chronic bronchial asthma. Clinical symptoms and medication intake were followed by filling in diary cards. Peak expiratory flow, measured four times a day, was also followed. Intradermal skin tests and bronchial challenge tests were performed with allergen together with an evaluation of nonspecific bronchial reactivity. Specific IgE and IgG antibodies were assayed after separation from the bulk of serum immunoglobulins by immunoadsorption. The study was carried out over two years according to a double-blind protocol. Intradermal inoculation of antigen-antibody complexes resulted in a marked reduction of both clinical and medication scores. No systemic side-effects were observed and only mild wheal and flare reactions were noted at the injection site. The treatment showed a drastic reduction of specific skin and bronchial reactivities with only marginal effects on nonspecific bronchial reactivity. Concentrations of specific IgE antibodies decreased significantly during the first weeks of treatment and remained at these lower values throughout the study. Specific IgG antibodies actually decreased in the majority of treated patients. The total amount of allergen used in this study was less than 1% of the amount currently used for conventional hyposensitization with the same allergen. These findings show that antigen-antibody complex inoculation is an efficient and safe means of treating allergic bronchial asthma and that the mechanism of action is likely to differ from conventional hyposensitization.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"allergic bronchial asthma\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"inoculation of allergen-antibody complexes\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

Median age was 54, and M/F 1.3. At diagnosis, 26 patients had refractory anaemia with an excess of blasts in transformation (RAEB-T) three had refractory anaemia (RA), 11 had refractory anaemia with excessive blasts (RAEB) and seven had chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML). Treatment was started within 3 months of diagnosis in 30 patients, and after more than 3 months in the 17 remaining patients. At the onset of treatment, 16 patients had progressed to acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Twenty-two patients (47%) reached complete remission (CR), 10 (21%) had hypoplastic death and 15 (32%) had resistant disease. Median actuarial disease-free interval was 11 months. Median actuarial survival was 14 months from diagnosis and 10 months from the onset of treatment. A significantly higher CR rate was found in patients with RAEB-T at diagnosis (69% v 19% in patients with other FAB subtypes: P = 0.008), and in patients treated within 3 months of diagnosis. Using multivariate analysis, RAEB-T at diagnosis emerged as the most powerful prognostic factor of CR achievement. Karyotype was the only significant prognostic factor of disease-free interval, with a median of 16.5 months in patients with normal karyotype versus 4 months in patients with normal findings (P = 0.018). A subgroup of 15 patients with RAEB-T at diagnosis and normal karyotype, who had a CR rate of 80% and a median actuarial disease-free interval of 18 months, could be identified. Our results confirm that, overall, intensive chemotherapy has limited efficacy in MDS, especially when compared with allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Relatively favourable results were obtained in our patients with RAEB-T at diagnosis, however, particularly those with normal karyotype. In that subgroup, intensive chemotherapy may be recommended, especially before BMT, as a high risk of relapse after BMT in patients with RAEB-T allografted as first line therapy has been reported.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"myelodysplastic syndromes\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"intensive chemotherapy\", \"CureRate\": \"0.47\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

The average age at operation was 47.5 years. At two years from operation 71% of the hips had a clinically satisfactory result and at final follow-up, an average of 8.2 years after operation, 58% continued to have excellent or good rating. Twenty-four hips had needed total replacement or arthrodesis because of pain. Patients aged less than 55 did better than those operated on after that age, and hips with an idiopathic or post-traumatic aetiology did considerably better than alcohol-induced or steroid-induced cases.

Although some successful reports of intra-arterial chemotherapy for HCC. have been documented, most of the therapeutic effects are transient and the survival rate is not satisfactory. This report is of a rare case, that of a long-term survivor with HCC treated by intra-arterial chemotherapy and immunotherapy. A 66-year-old man, with a 10-year history of liver cirrhosis was admitted to The Center for Adult Diseases, Osaka, after detection of a tumor in the right lobe on US. On admission, serum AFP was within normal range, HBs-Ag was negative, and ICG-R 15 was 20.8%. On hepatic angiogram, a hypervascular tumor (6 cm in size) was recognized in the middle of the right lobe. He was assessed as unresectable because of insufficient reserve capacity, and the catheterization of the hepatic artery for intra-arterial chemotherapy and the injection 35 KE of OK-432 into the tumor were carried out under laparotomy. After the procedure, the patient was treated by intra-arterial infusion of doxorubicin (ADR) at a total dose of 150 mg and 5-FU in total dose of 25 g, with a hypodermic injection of OK-432 at a total dose of 161 KE. Hepatic angiography, carried out one year after the procedure, disclosed no foci in the liver. The duration of complete remission continued more than 5 years.

The infection rate was 0.4 per cent, and the nonunion rate was 0.8 per cent. Shortening of more than 2 cm. was seen in seven cases (3 per cent), and malrotation of more than 20 degrees was noted in four cases (1.7 per cent). These more common problems of shortening and rotation were almost eliminated by the increased use of cerclage wire and postoperative traction and spica casts. Knee range of motion averaged 128 degrees. These fractures provide interesting and difficult challenges. Intramedullary nailing of the segmental fractures is technically demanding but offers excellent results in these otherwise difficult fractures. Patients with grade I and grade II comminuted fractures do well with intramedullary nailing and the bones remain stable. Grade III and grade IV comminuted fractures are unstable and pose the risk of shortening and rotation. Therefore, to gain anatomic restoration in a young person we believe that it is reasonable to perform an open reduction and cerclage wiring of these fractures. The postoperative treatment of the comminuted femoral fracture is determined by both fracture stability and patient reliability, and frequent roentgenograms are indicated.

The ascites index, the ratio of the ascitic fluid volumes before and after intraperitoneal immunotherapy, was significantly higher in the patients who died than in those who survived. The side effects of intraperitoneal administration of OK-432 varied, but were not serious and relief was not needed in most cases. Intraperitoneal injection of OK-432 was considered effective in preventing the reappearance of ascites in these cases of advanced ovarian cancer, and the ascites index was believed to be related to the prognosis.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"ovarian cancer\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"intraperitoneal immunotherapy with OK-432\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

Remission was successfully reinduced after reinduction chemotherapy consisting of daunorubicin, cytosine arabinoside, etoposide and vincristine, but was complicated by neutropenia. After the therapy, the patient had persistent fever of about 38 degrees C despite broad-spectrum antibiotics therapy and the patient developed pain in the right quadrant of the abdomen. The white blood cell count rose to 23000/mm3. Liver function tests showed abnormal findings mainly consisting of an elevated serum alkaline phosphatase level. Ultrasonography showed multiple hypoechoic lesions in the liver and CT scans also revealed multiple low density areas. Therefore he was suspected of having a complication of liver abscesses. Amphotericin B was administered 75 mg/day intravenously every other day. A percutaneous liver biopsy was performed, but was not diagnostic. Blood cultures were negative for pathogens. Amphotericin B was administered up to a cumulative dosage of 2.3 g, but the patient remained febrile. Then he had an exploratory laparotomy and an open liver biopsy. The liver biopsy samples showed fungal elements proved by PAS staining. A catheter was inserted into the portal vein. Administration of Amphotericin B was started 20 mg daily through the catheter. The temperature fell to normal after institution of this therapy.

The study was carried out on 45 female patients, aged between 34 and 61 years, undergoing cholecystectomy who were randomly divided into three groups. Group 1 (age: 50.33 +/- 8.64 years) received 100 ml of 5% mannitol solution i.v.; group 2 (age: 49.80 +/- 11.11 years) 100 ml of a mannitol solution containing 7.5 mg/kg L-tryptophan; and group 3 (age: 53.46 +/- 9.60 years) 100 ml of a mannitol solution containing 15 mg/kg L-tryptophan. Vital capacity (preoperative VC) was measured before surgery. Anesthesia used was isoflurane. Narcotics or neuroleptics were not used. Pain was assessed before treatment (T-0 min), at the end of administration (T-30) and at T-60, 120, 180, 240, 300 and 360 min by the following variables: respiratory rate (RR), heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP), Scott-Huskisson test (VAS), pain vital capacity (PVC), analgesic vital capacity (AVC), and respiratory restoration factor (RRF) calculated from Bromage's formula (RRF = (AVC - PVC/preoperative VC - PVC) X 100). As regards variables RR, HR, MAP and VAS, differences between the values from T-30 to T-360 and the value at T-0 were calculated. Means and S.E.M. were calculated on the obtained values and on RRF values for each group. The significance of the differences between groups was calculated using Student's t test and Bonferroni's test. Results show a significant decrease of pain in groups 2 and 3 treated with L-tryptophan, in comparison with group 1 (controls). No significant difference was observed between the treated groups, although more lasting pain relief was observed in group 3 in comparison with group 2. Intravenous L-tryptophan showed its effectiveness in the treatment of postoperative pain even when used alone.

Aspects on treatment modalities with reference to a study on patients treated by irradiation.\nAbstract: Irradiation is the most common form of treatment of tonsillar region carcinomas in Scandinavia. During recent years, encouraging results have been reported when surgery has been performed. Therefore, an effort was made to compare different treatment principles on the basis of a study on patients treated by irradiation. This retrospective study comprised 37 patients over a 20-year period. The relative 5-year survival was 33%. Most of the patients died in the next two years after diagnosis. Seventy-three percent of the patients initially had signs of regional metastasis. Hardly 20% of these were still alive after 5 years, while patients without evidence of metastasis had a 5-year survival of 50%. Neither the size, nor the histopathological features of the primary tumor seemed to affect the incidence of regional metastasis. The duration of symptoms before diagnosis, however, seemed to influence prognosis. Surgical consideration alone, or in combination with irradiation, should be made in cases with large primary tumor with regional lymph node involvement. In other cases, however, there was no evidence suggesting surgery as a better form of therapy than irradiation alone.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"tonsillar region carcinoma\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"irradiation\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

A 24-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital with severe asthmatic attack. Although she was treated by intravenous administration of aminophylline and corticosteroids, pulmonary function and consciousness deteriorated. Therefore, she was intubated nasally and mechanically ventilated by IPPV with administration of aminophylline, corticosteroids and epinephrine. Despite this treatment, she remained in status asthmaticus with high airway pressure and barotrauma causing pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema. On the 3rd hospital day, a system was arranged so that isoflurane could be given in an air and oxygen mixture, and administration was started with a concentration of isoflurane of 1.5%. In addition, bronchial lavage via bronchoscopy was performed in order to clear any mucous plugs. After 24 hours, there was marked improvement of wheezing, airway pressure and arterial blood gas level. Eventually, she was weaned from the ventilator on the 6th hospital day without significant side effects. The use of halothane inhalational anesthetic treatment for status asthmaticus is widely known, but it has serious side effects such as arrhythmia and liver injury.

A prolonged chest pain (more than two hours) with a major electrocardiographic lesion in the posterior leads needed an urgent coronary arteriography in order to attempt a recanalization. Antecedents of arteriopathy of the lower limbs with aortobifemoral bypass required an axillary artery right side approach. A selective right coronary opacification showed complete occlusion at the junction of segments 1 and 2. An intracoronary injection of isosorbide dinitrate relieved a coronary spasm and allowed a complete visualization of the right coronary artery. This appeared to be very atherosclerotic with several severe narrowings, and a subocclusive lesion at the site of the initial occlusion. Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasties (PTCA) were performed and led to real 'restructuring' of the right coronary artery. The clinical outcome was excellent without recurrent angina pectoris. An angiographic control performed 6 months after PTCA demonstrated the persistence of the coronary recanalization and an evident improvement of the segmental contractility. This report emphasizes the role of coronary spasm in the genesis of myocardial infarction and shows that PTCA may be performed as a first approach at the acute phase of myocardial infarction; to our knowledge it is the first PTCA performed by an axillary approach at the acute stage of myocardial infarction.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"myocardial infarction\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"isosorbide dinitrate, transluminal angioplasty\", \"CureRate\": \"1.0\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [\"coronary angiography,intracoronary injection of isosorbide dinitrate\"], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

The most efficient treatment has, until now, been dermoplasty of the nasal septum and cavity. There have been a few reports on treatment with CO2-, argon- or Nd-YAG-lasers, which have been encouraging. Ten patients with Osler's disease were treated for severe epistaxis. Three were treated with CO2-laser, two of these under general anaesthesia. Seven patients were treated with the argon laser under local anaesthesia. A variety of other sites were treated at the same time for functional or cosmetic reasons (mouth, face, fingers, rectum). Good results were obtained in eight cases. In three of the cases the observation period was more than two years. A second treatment has been necessary in three cases. Two other patients were treated recently, and it is too early to judge the results. The argon-laser is more convenient for this purpose than the CO2-laser. The method is quick and reliable and there is no need for hospitalization. The treatment can be repeated without permanent damage to the function of the nose.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"laser surgery\", \"CureRate\": \"0.8\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

However, side effects caused by irradiation are sometimes troublesome to a patient and to a physician. Among side effects, oncogenic problem and late radiation change are most undesirable and may become fatal. Hence, we avoid radiation therapy especially for younger aged patients. We prefer surgical therapy to radiotherapy for such a case. In our clinic, laser therapy has been employed. A laser beam is introduced through an operation microscope and a lesion can be microscopically vaporized. In this study, a survey of 40 patients with T1 glottic cancer submitted to laser surgery was reviewed. From those patients 25 were T1a and 15 were T1b. From our experience, laser vaporization is recommendable for T1 glottic cancer in younger aged patients.

At least 1 cm of normal parenchyma surrounded the tumour and no microscopic invasion of resection margins was evident. The disease was staged according to our own staging system. Lobectomy was performed in 50 patients and non-anatomical resection in the remainder. The postoperative mortality rate was 5 per cent and the major morbidity rate was 11 per cent. The actuarial 5-year survival rate for patients in stages I, II and III was 42 per cent, 34 per cent and 15 per cent respectively (P less than 0.001). The overall actuarial 5-year survival rate was 30 per cent. The prognostic importance of various patient and tumour variables was evaluated by univariate analysis and then by multivariate analysis. Age of patient, site of primary, disease-free interval between treatment of primary and of hepatic metastases, preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen levels, and number of metastases, did not relate to prognosis, while sex (P = 0.024), stage of primary (P = 0.026), extent of liver involvement (P less than 0.001), distribution of metastases (P = 0.01) and type of surgery (P = 0.028) significantly affected prognosis as single factors. Multivariate analysis revealed that only the extent of liver involvement and stage of the primary tumour were independent predictors of survival. We conclude that liver resection is effective in selected patients with hepatic metastases from colorectal cancer.

These cases ranged from 24-72 years of age (average 42), 11 were males and 12 females. There were 19 primary cases and 4 postoperative cases of recurrence, and the period of their clinical courses ranged from 2 months to 23 years. Concerning the operative procedure, in 22 cases the approach was via an upper midline incision and 1 case the approach was via left thoraco-abdominal incision. Intraoperative manometry was performed to help in judging the extent of each manipulation. With the operative manipulation, the LESP is reduced to 13.0 +/- 6.0 mmHg (39% of the average preoperative value) and HPZ is elongated to 60.9 +/- 14.1 mm (155% of the average preoperative value). Moreover, post-operative manometry data resembled intra-operative data. The effectiveness of the procedure is judged on the basis of the chief complaints, esophagography, endoscopic examination, esophageal manometry and 24-hr pH monitoring. Patients are followed up at 2 weeks, 3 months and 1 year from the operation. Results showed 22 excellent cases (96.65%), 1 fair case (4.34%). These are better results than those of other reports that showed 50-60% excellent results and 30% good results (remaining slight passage disturbance). The reason for this difference is that we obtain sufficient LESP decompression effect (myotomy + submucosal layer ablation) based on intraoperative manometry. In the only case that we judged as fair (a reoperated case after Heller's operation) showed severe EGR totalling 213 min. on 24-hr pH monitoring of the esophagus in the postoperative period and was erosion also seen in the lower esophagus endoscopically. In this case, the LESP was 6.0 mmHg and its HPZ is 27.0 mm, showing a higher HPZ than the non-reflux group. Among the non-reflux group, LESP was as low as 6.0 mmHg, and this case had a remarkable long HPZ of 57.0 mm. In conclusion, even though the LESP is low, it is possible to prevent reflux if the HPZ is sufficiently long.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"esophageal achalasia\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"long myotomy + partial fundopexy + posterior fixation based on intraoperative manometry\", \"CureRate\": \"0.9665\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

Radiating pain and weakness occurred when she tried to stand up on Dec. 25 in 1989. She was admitted to our hospital in October 1990. Physical examination showed emaciation, hypesthesia of extremities, hypesthesia over the right chest and back, impaired vibration and position sense, and hyperreflexia. Laboratory findings revealed that the erythrocyte sedimentation rate was elevated to 46mm/hr, rheumatoid factor (RF) to 83.1IU/ml and CRP to 3.7mg/dl. Her blood sugar was high and she was diagnosed as having diabetes mellitus. Cervical X ray film showed atlanto-axial subluxation. A pseudotumor around the odontoid process bulging into the spinal canal and compression of the upper cervical cord was observed by MRI. In spite of administration of bucillamine (100mg/day), the size of pseudotumor did not change. Methotrexate (MTX) at a dose of 5mg/week was started in February 1991 and the pseudotumor decreased in size with a concurrent reduction of ESR, RF and CRP. However, the high intensity lesion by T2 weighed image did not change and dysesthesia persisted. The pseudotumor was thought to be due to pannus and it was revealed that MTX was effective for reduction.

To determine if lesions that are likely to recur may be predicted at the time of surgery, data from 5020 patients with 7010 basal-cell carcinomas treated with Mohs' technique were reviewed. Two thousand nine hundred sixty (2960) lesions with five-year follow-up were studied (overall recurrence rate = 2.6%). Sex and age of the patients, size and location of lesions, types of previous therapy, and the number of surgical stages of microscopically controlled excision were all found to correlate significantly with recurrence rate (p less than 0.01). Multiple regression analysis was performed to determine the relative contribution of each of these variables to predictability of recurrences by a weighted scoring system. The derived model delineated the lesions into no-risk, low-, medium-, and high-risk groupings (p less than 0.000001). Lesions in the high-risk group had a recurrence rate of 10.1%, almost four times greater than the average.

In the following years the right orbicularis oris muscle and platysma were unilaterally and progressively involved in the spasms and with increasing frequency. Medical treatment with minor transquilizer was not effective. She was referred to our department at the age of 16. CT and MRI revealed no abnormality. Angiographical study revealed that the right PICA (posterior inferior cerebellar artery) was tourtously coming off from a relatively high portion of the right vertebral artery. The trunk of the right AICA (anterior inferior cerebellar artery) was not able to be identified. Although the onset of this condition was unusually early, the clinical course and symptoms of hemifacial spasm were so clearly typical that she underwent microvascular decompression surgery on July 26, 1988, at the age of 16. During the operation an upward looping PICA was found crossing and tightly compressing the exit zone of the right facial nerve. The offending artery seemed to be elastic without significant atherosclerotic change. The arterial loop was carefully dissected and replaced with two pieces of sponge prosthesis between the artery and the surface of brain stem. Her hemifacial spasm completely disappeared post-operatively. No recurrence has been noted for over one year in the follow-up observation. Hemifacial spasm is subacutely or chronically a progressive disorder of facial involuntary movement. The arterial compression in the exit zone of the facial nerve is said to be the cause of the disorder and microvascular decompression has been indicated for it since a little before the beginning of this decade.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"juvenile hemifacial spasm\", \"Symptoms\": [\"intermittent involuntary spasms of the right lower orbicularis oculi muscle\"], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"microvascular decompression surgery\", \"CureRate\": \"1.0\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [\"computed tomography (CT),magnetic resonance imaging (MRI),angiography\"], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

Twenty patients with hamstring muscle strains were assigned randomly to an Experimental Group (n = 10) or a Control Group (n = 10). Peak torque production of the quadriceps femoris and hamstring muscles and hamstring muscle length were measured before and after treatment. The hamstring muscles of the Experimental and Control groups were treated with moist heat followed by passive stretching. The Experimental Group also received manipulation of the sacroiliac joint. The change in hamstring muscle peak torque was significantly greater for the Experimental Group than for the Control Group (p less than .005).

The cases were collected through a cooperative effort of 57 surgeons at eight hospitals in the Detroit area and coordinated by the Michigan Cancer Foundation where data collection and analyses were completed. The primary treatment of all patients was a modified radical mastectomy. Of the 1,078 cases accessioned between October 1975 and April 1983, 537 were found to have no microscopic lymph node involvement and 462 of these cases received no adjuvant antineoplastic therapy. The period of follow-up of these cases (alive, n = 358) has been 78.75 +/- 24.6 months (mean +/- SD). Overall, the cumulative 6-year recurrence rate as calculated by life table analysis was 26%, with 16.8% dying of their disease. Tumor size was an important prognostic factor; the recurrence rate was 16.2% for those with primaries measuring less than or equal to 1 cm, with only a 6.3% mortality. Patients with tumors measuring greater than 5 cm also did well: 13.7% recurrence and 13.7% mortality rates at 6 years. The premenopausal women did slightly, but not statistically significantly, better than those who were postmenopausal. The presence or absence of quantifiable estrogen receptor protein (ER) was of little predictive value as far as rates of recurrence were concerned, but patients with an ER-positive tumor survived significantly longer. In postmenopausal women, those whose tumor lacked ER (n = 112) fared poorly: 30.4% experienced a recurrence by 6 years and 28% died of their disease. Recurrence rates and death rates were also high in a small group (n = 35) of postmenopausal women with ER+ tumors exhibiting nuclear pleomorphism (nuclear grade [NG]3) (38% and 24.3%, respectively).

Seven cases treated by muscle transplantation (author's transl).\nAbstract: Seven cases of upper brachial plexus palsy, have been treated by associated transplantation of pectoralis major for flexion, and of teres major and latissimus dorsi for external rotation. Operation was performed eighteen months at least after injury, during which period rehabilitation was necessary to prevent atrophy of the pectoralis major and contracture in internal rotation. The strength of flexion was improved by alterations of the original Clark's operation. The whole muscle was transplanted: its humeral tendon was fixed to the coracoid process; its thoracic extremity lengthened by an aponevrotic flap from rectus anterior was pulled through a posterior anti-brachial incision, holding the arm in anteposition and the forearm in supination.

There were 10 hemispherectomies, 32 temporal lobectomies and eight operations to other areas of the brain. The median age at operation was 14 years. 29 patients were found to have mesial temporal sclerosis or sclerotic hemispheres and 17 had alien tissue and one sclerosis with heterotopia. No lesion was found in three cases. The nature of the first seizure was found to relate significantly to pathology. 30 patients had suffered an early convulsion. Between the convulsive insult and the onset of focal epilepsy there was a silent interval, the duration of which was biased by sex and side of lesion. The remaining 20 patients, of whom a highly significant number had alien tissue, had not had an early convulsion before the onset of focal epilepsy. The importance of accurate clinical histories is stressed. Clinical considerations alone predicted the pathology and laterality of the lesion in more than half the series. Regular EEG recordings and repeat scanning were found to be important investigations. Major disorders of behaviour had occurred in 44 patients. As adults, the series were free of severe psychiatric symptoms, but many required years of careful rehabilitation. 31 children had been excluded from normal schools before operation. Postoperatively, many patients continued their education in normal schools. Some required basic remedial teaching, others successfully undertook higher education and training. 49 patients benefited over-all from neurosurgical treatment. 34 had no more habitual epilepsy at all.

Review of 345 consecutive cases treated over a period of 12 years.\nAbstract: This paper reports experience with 345 patients admitted to a neurosurgical department after an aneurysm rupture. At the time of admission, patients were separated into two groups: the patients unsuitable for planned surgery and called 'unoperable'; the patients planned for surgery and called 'operable patients' (328 patients). The general management attitude consisted of deferred surgery according to the clinical status of the patients and the risk of vasospasm and ischaemia. Of these, 18 died before the day of surgery, and are called 'operable and non-operated' patients. The cause of death was vasospasm and ischaemia in 10 cases and recurrence of haemorrhage in 8 cases. 310 patients were actually operated upon. Their final outcome was: good 70%, fair 9.6%, poor 7.7%, death 12.5%.

Nutritional supplementation by the nasogastric route produced a rapid sustained increase in growth rate, associated with striking reductions in pain crises and infections which had previously necessitated many hospital admissions. Oral supplementation improved the clinical course but had no effect on growth rate. Mineral and vitamin supplements influenced neither the growth rate nor the clinical course.

Deformity and bone loss treated by open reduction, internal fixation, and human bone morphogenetic protein (hBMP).\nAbstract: Four patients with severely deformed nonunions of the distal end of the tibia failed to respond to standard surgical methods and were successfully treated as follows: debridement of fibrous tissue, sequestrectomy, correction of angulatory deformities, internal stabilization, and implantation of human bone morphogenetic protein (hBMP). After resection of the sequestra, all four patients had significant bone defects of the anterior tibial cortex extending to the ankle joint. The average number of failed previous surgical procedures was 5.8. The average patient age was 35.3 years. The intervals of nonunion averaged 24.8 months. In two patients, the hBMP, including other low molecular weight bone matrix noncollagenous proteins (hBMP/NCP), was implanted across the fracture site in polylactic-polyglycollic acid strips (1 X 13 cm) as an onlay graft. In one patient, the BMP was implanted in the fracture gap in absorbable gelatin (No. 5 capsules). In another patient, the BMP/NCP was also implanted in the form of a composite of cortical allogeneic bone in addition to a capsule of BMP/NCP. In all four cases, alignment was restored and the bone ends were stabilized with internal fixation. Preoperatively, the ankle joints were ankylosed and painful. Healed fractures and functional ankle joints were observed in three of four patients at an average of 4.4 months. In one patient, the fracture healed but the joint remained ankylosed. Although a randomized double-blind consecutive series of matched cases is necessary to prove the efficacy of hBMP, implants of hBMP combined with skillful surgical treatment are under investigation in the interim as an alternative to amputation.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"distal metaphyseal tibial nonunion\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"open reduction, internal fixation, and human bone morphogenetic protein\", \"CureRate\": \"0.75\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

Our studies confirm the normal values to be expected in patients who have had complete recovery from the acute empyema, and we lay to rest any concern that decortication might, in time, limit pulmonary function.

Twenty-two patients (17 males, 5 females) with spontaneous bacteremia (n = 7) or bacterial peritonitis (n = 15) were treated with oral pefloxacin 400 mg per 24 hr alone (n = 1) or in combination with another oral antibiotic, trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole (n = 13), amoxicillin (n = 6), cefadroxil (n = 2), or metronidazole (n = 1). In patients with spontaneous bacteremia, all organisms were found to be sensitive to oral antibiotics, and a favorable response was elicited in 6 out of 7 (86 p. cent) within 3 days (mean) of treatment. In patients with spontaneous peritonitis, ascitic fluid cultures were positive in 11 cases, and organisms were sensitive to pefloxacin in 9 out of 11 cases. A favorable response was elicited in 13 out of 15 within 2 to 8 days of treatment. Fourteen patients died (64 p. cent), 3 of infection (bacteremia n = 1, peritonitis n = 2), and 11 patients of causes unrelated to infection, mainly variceal hemorrhage, hepatorenal syndrome or hepatocellular carcinoma, although the clinical symptoms of infection were controlled. One-year survival was 57 p. cent in patients with bacteremia and 33 p. cent in those with bacterial peritonitis. Oral treatment was well tolerated in all patients.

Our purpose was to determine whether or not patients with a low risk of relapse can be identified at the time of the initial staging evaluation. In 30 of 82 patients (Group 1), embryonal carcinoma constituted less than 80 percent of the tumor, no vessel invasion was present, and the preorchiectomy serum AFP level was less than 80 ng/dL. No relapses occurred in this group. Fifty-two patients (Group 2) had more than 80 percent embryonal carcinoma or vessel invasion or a serum AFP level higher than 80 ng/dL. Relapse occurred in 24 (46%) of these patients. The difference in the rate of relapse between patients in Group 1 and Group 2 was statistically significant (P less than 0.00001). A separate analysis of teratoma as a predictor of nonrelapse showed that the orchiectomy specimens of 30 of the 82 patients contained more than 50 percent teratoma. Only 1 relapse occurred among 25 patients with more than 50 percent teratoma and no vessel invasion. Our data show that there is a subgroup of patients with clinical Stage I nonseminomatous germ cell tumor who have a very low rate of relapse. We believe these patients can be effectively treated by surveillance and should be spared the morbidity of an unnecessary retroperitoneal lymph node dissection.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"nonseminomatous testicular tumors\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"orchidectomy\", \"CureRate\": \"0.707\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

Serum laboratory findings included elevation of serum bilirubin and AST, prolongation of serum prothrombin time and a positive monospot. A tentative diagnosis of acute fatty liver of pregnancy was made, and a healthy male infant was delivered by emergency cesarean section because of fetal distress. Over the subsequent 3 days, acute progressive oliguric renal failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation, hypoglycemia requiring intravenous dextrose infusion and pancreatitis developed; her mental status progressed to stage III encephalopathy. Quantitative computed tomography estimated the liver volume to be 770 cm3. The decision to proceed with orthotopic liver transplantation was made on the basis of progressive clinical deterioration despite aggressive support and because of her small liver size. After transplant, the patient's multisystem failure rapidly reversed. Histopathological examination of the native liver demonstrated predominantly zone 3 microvesicular steatosis with characteristic ultrastructural changes consistent with acute fatty liver of pregnancy. Southern blot analysis for Epstein-Barr virus DNA was negative. We conclude that orthotopic liver transplantation should be considered for the small group of patients with fulminant hepatic failure associated with acute fatty liver of pregnancy who manifest signs of irreversible liver failure despite delivery of the fetus and aggresive supportive care.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"fulminant hepatic failure\", \"Symptoms\": [\"fever\", \"vomiting\", \"diarrhea\", \"malaise\"], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"orthotopic liver transplantation\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [\"serum laboratory findings,quantitative computed tomography\"], \"Causes\": \"acute fatty liver of pregnancy\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

To examine shrinkage of the hepatic metastasis and the peritoneal tumors, A \"Second look\" operation was conducted. Abdominal simple total hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, omentectomy and partial sigmoidectomy resulted in no residual lesions in the peritoneal cavity with the exception of the hepatic metastatic lesion (69 x 57 mm). Two additional courses of PAC therapy were administered after the \"Second look\" operation. The hepatic metastatic lesion shrank to 45 x 41 mm; a decrease of 83.8% compared to the pre-therapy in size.

We describe an uncommon variant of acute pancreatitis in which signs of inflammation persist over a number of months, waxing and waning but never disappearing. Neither identifiable collections nor other targets for surgical drainage develop in these patients, nor does their condition ever remit enough to allow them to leave the hospital. Eating provokes a flareup of inflammation. We have treated five such patients with a pancreatoduodenectomy (four patients) or total pancreatectomy (one patient). Each patient had been continuously hospitalized for six to 12 weeks before operation. All survived the operation and left the hospital eating solid food within 16 days. In addition to acute inflammation and fat necrosis, the resected specimens showed main pancreatic duct stenosis or occlusion in three patients, a pancreaticoduodenal fistula in one, and a congenital duplication cyst. Pancreatography or cholangiography showed the lesion in three of four cases and helped in planning therapy. Thus, acute pancreatitis may fall to remit because of proximal pancreatic duct obstruction, for which pancreatoduodenectomy is a reasonable and effective treatment.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"acute pancreatitis\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"pancreatoduodenectomy\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

This combined approach may allow obliteration of unresectable acquired or congenital arteriovenous malformations.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"paraplegia\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"paraplegia surgery and embolization\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"post-traumatic\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

Synovial sarcoma of the endolarynx is extremely rare, only one previously reported case appearing in English literature. Contrary to earlier beliefs, this tumor does not arise from the synovial lining of joints and bursa but develops from pleuripotential mesenchymal cells through abnormal differentiation into synovial neoplasms. Microscopically the tumor is characterized by a biphasic pattern of pseudoepithelial cells and a spindle cell element with fibrosarcomatous appearance. One additional case of synovial sarcoma of the endolarynx is reported. The tumor arose from the right subglottic area and presented submucosally. It was treated by extended frontolateral partial vertical (hemi) laryngectomy. The patient is alive and well 3 years after surgery. This case is the first reported to be successfully treated by partial laryngeal surgery alone. The histopathology of synovial sarcoma is reviewed and details of the biopsy and surgical technique are presented.

Two factors are accepted by all authors as being of major importance: the need for early treatment to avoid degeneration; the advantage of maximum mucosal excision to avoid repeated follow up examinations and removal of further polyps from the remaining rectum. Three cases of familial polyposis and Gardner's syndrome were treated by either total colectomy and rectal mucosectomy (2 cases) or a partial Reifferscheid procedure (1 case).

She had no personal or family history of stigmas of tuberous sclerosis. On physical examination, a movable hard smooth mass of fist size was palpable in the right abdomen. Drip infusion pyelography revealed an elevation of right kidney. Ultrasonography revealed that the abdominal mass had a high amplitude echo area. On CT the mass was heterogeneous with irregular margin and had regions of low attenuation value, suspicious of a tumor with high fat content. An angiogram of the right renal artery revealed a hypervascular tumor showing multiple saccular aneurysms, and absence of arteriovenous shunting. Based on the aforementioned findings, the mass was diagnosed as renal angiomyolipoma. Partial right nephrectomy was performed through an extraperitoneal approach.

Idiopathic, atypical and symptomatic trigeminal neuralgia has been diagnosed respectively in 568, 21 and 16 cases. From 1977 to 1980 the working temperature was above 65 C, thereafter a lower temperature has been employed to coagulate the Gasserian ganglion. The rate of pain relief was 97% for idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia, 75% for symptomatic and 21% for atypical. The loss of facial sensation accounts for 80% of side effects of this procedure in their series. The recurrence of pain was observed in 16% of cases with a follow-up ranging from 2 to 10 years. It is noteworthy that there is a correlation between the coagulation temperature and the rate of recurrence, the higher the former, the lower the latter.

Selection of the patients was based solely on arteriographic criteria. Arteriography after dilatation showed considerable widening of the stenosed area in all patients. In 65 patients the effect of treatment on the blood pressure was assessed during follow up periods of one to four years. In 14 of these patients the hypertension was cured, in 29 it was improved, and in 22 there was no change. Patients with fibromuscular lesions benefited distinctly more than did those with atheromatous stenosis, only one of the 21 patients with fibromuscular lesions showing no change as compared with 21 of the 44 patients with atheromatous lesions. The only serious complication encountered was microcholesterol emboli, which developed in two patients with severe atheromatous lesions of the aorta. In the atheromatous group age and overall renal function had no influence on the blood pressure response. In the subgroup of patients with a unilateral lesion the renal vein renin ratios and asymmetrical curves obtained by renography had only a very limited predictive value. In experienced hands percutaneous transluminal arterial dilatation is relatively safe, and this study suggests that it should be attempted in all patients with renal artery stenosis. Only in patients with severe atheromatosis of the aorta should the risk associated with the catheterisation be weighed against the 50% or so chance of benefit from the procedure.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"renal artery stenosis\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"percutaneous transluminal arterial dilatation\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [\"arteriography\"], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

A 42-year-old man was admitted for a heart murmur and abnormal findings in the screening chest roentgenogram. Having no symptoms on admission, his physical activity was evaluated as Class I according to the classification of the New York Heart Association. A systolic murmur (Levine III/VI) with split second sound was audible at the left sternal border in the 3rd intercostal space. Chest roentgenogram revealed 57% of the cardio-thoracic ratio and no signs of increased pulmonary vascular markings. ECG showed incomplete right bundle branch block. Echocardiography and right ventriculography visualized the supravalvular membranous structured stenosed pulmonary artery 1cm above the pulmonic valve. Systolic pressure gradient between the right ventricle and the distal main pulmonary trunk was 54mmHg. The patient was diagnosed as having pulmonary supravalvular membranous stenosis. PTBD was applied using Inoue balloon catheter, where inflation was initiated from approximately 120% of pulmonary arterial diameter and terminated at 150%. This procedure decreased systolic pressure gradient from 54mmHg to 36mmHg without complication. After PTBD right ventriculography demonstrated that a part of the membranous structure had become floppy and movable. Pulmonary arterial diameter was unchanged. We considered that PTBD tore the membranous structure, which consequently resulted in the decrease of systolic pressure gradient. Systolic murmur diminished to Levine II/VI. Six months later, cardiac catheterization showed no change in systolic pressure gradient compared with that immediately after PTBD.

The overall complication rate of dialysis was high (31 of 44 patients), but was significantly lower in survivors.

Therefore, valves of 24 CAPD patients (ages 55 +/- 11 years; CAPD duration: 29 +/- 28 months) were studied in a prospective echocardiographic and Doppler echocardiographic follow-up analysis over 35 months. Most frequent findings were sclerosis of the aortic annulus (100% at both assessments) and of the anterior mitral valve leaflet (first vs. follow-up assessment: 88 vs. 96%). Sclerosis of the mitral valve annulus (58% vs. 63%), right coronary (54 vs. 63%) and noncoronary (50 vs. 67%) cuspis of the aortic valve and of the posterior mitral valve leaflet (25 vs. 50%) were less frequent but tended to be progressive (p = NS).

After delivery she continued to have active TTP with thrombocytopenia which responded repeatedly to plasma infusion though their frequency gradually decreased to about one unit every 3-4 weeks. Three years after the birth of the first child she conceived again and was easily managed with repeated plasma infusions although the frequency and amount of plasma required to prevent thrombocytopenia were increased. She delivered a normal 3.4 kg term baby after which she again had a decreased plasma requirement. This is the first report of a woman with 5 years of active TTP managed with plasma alone. She experienced two pregnancies in which both mother and infant survived. We believe that the use of plasma in the management of TTP during pregnancy will improve the survival rate of both mother and infant.

The mean low oesophageal sphincter pressure was 8.5 +/- 6.5 cm H2O. No patient died in the postoperative period. Morbidity consisted of 8 splenic injuries, as well as 8 pulmonary and 23 thromboembolic complications. Assessment of 199 patients (79 percent) with a mean follow-up of 32 +/- 21 months showed complete symptomatic relief in 96.5 percent, and complete endoscopic healing of oesophagitis was noted in 96 percent. Restoration of the pH profile to normal levels was obtained in 86 percent of the cases. The mean low oesophageal sphincter pressure had risen to 17 +/- 6 cm H2O. Early postoperative dysphagia was noted in 46 patients (18 percent); one of them required reoperation. Reflux symptoms persisted in 9 patients (4.5 percent). pH monitoring revealed abnormal levels in 3 patients.

All patients were 20 years or older at the time of surgery and none had undergone a prior surgical procedure. Indications for surgery included pain, progressive deformity, and pulmonary symptoms. All patients had a posterior spinal fusion with Harrington instrumentation and autogenous iliac bone graft, with the addition of segmental wiring in only eight. No patient had an anterior fusion or fusion to the sacrum. Follow-up averaged 3.5 years (range: 2-7 years). The average correction at the time of surgery was 38%, and 32% at the time of last follow-up. Seventy-nine percent of the patients reported complete relief of the symptom(s) for which they had surgery. There were 34 complications in 30 (33%) patients. Pseudarthrosis occurred in 14 (15%), requiring 15 additional procedures to achieve a solid arthrodesis. Urinary tract infection occurred in 8 (9%) patients and Harrington hook dislodgement in 5 (5%).

CT scan revealed swelling of the para-aortic lymph nodes which was taken to be evidence of metastases of the gastric carcinoma. The patient was considered to have surgically non-curative gastric carcinoma (Stage IV), and preoperative chemotherapy was initiated. The regimen consisted of CDDP 50 mg (day 1-2, drip), 5-FU 750 mg (day 2-7, drip) and UFT 400 mg (from day 8 to the day before operation, oral). About one month after initiating treatment, total gastrectomy with lymph node dissection was performed. Histopathological examination of the section of the primary tumor revealed that only a few cancer cell nests (poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma) remained in the muscle and subserosal layer. In all of the lymph nodes which were suspected to have metastases preoperatively, cancer cells completely degenerated into mucinous lakes or foam cell nests.

Before CMA administration, both cases showed normal chemosensitivity of hypoxic and hypercapnic ventilatory responses (HVR and HCVR) at daytime, although marked oxygen desaturation with sleep apnea was observed. During CMA administration for 7 days, HVR, HCVR and occlusion pressure response to flow-resistive loading were altogether augmented. In one case obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) was altered to obstructive hypopnea, and in the other case central apnea disappeared completely, resulting in remarkable improvement of oxygen desaturation at sleep and daytime somnolence in both cases.

All had been treated by an extremely rigorous conservative regime in which the patients were kept in hospital for an average period of twenty-six months, during which time they were confined to bed with the legs in wide abduction, first in traction and later in \"broomstick\" plasters to ensure \"containment\" of the femoral head. The patients were assessed by the joint clincial and radiological method described by Ratliff (1956). The results were very satisfactory, with only 2 per cent poor results and 10 per cent fair. The remaining 88 per cent were good. The radiological results at the end of treatment have also been compared with control series described by Catterall (1972) and with the osteotomy series of Lloyd-Roberts, Catterall and Salamon (1976). From this it appears that the described regime offers no benefit compared with the natural history in Catterall's Groups I and II, and in Group III the results were only marginally better than those following osteotomy. In Group IV cases, however, where the femoral head was totally involved, the benefit was important, and since these are the cases which carry the worst natural prognosis it is suggested that the use of the method described in such instances must be seriously considered in spite of its social disadvantages. The theoretical implications of the findings are considered, and it is concluded that the benefits of the method cannot be ascribed wholly to the application of the \"containment\" principle.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"perthes' disease\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"prolonged recumbency and femoral head containment\", \"CureRate\": \"0.88\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

Langerhans' cell (LC) and T-cell were stained immunohistochemically on the specimens excised from the cervical cancer. In squamous cell carcinoma, 5-year survival rates for patients with LC infiltration were significantly better than those without LC (78% versus 60%; P &lt; 0.01). The 5-year survival rate of patients with T-cell infiltration also was significantly better than that of patients without such infiltration (83% versus 61%; P &lt; 0.05). Similar trends were observed in patients with adenocarcinoma; 5-year survival rates for patients with LC infiltration and those without LC infiltration were 49% and 25%, respectively (P &lt; 0.025). The survival rates for patients with T-cell infiltration and those without were 50% and 33%, respectively (P &lt; 0.1). An analysis of patterns of failure of radiation therapy demonstrated that the favorable prognosis in LC infiltration was attributable mainly to improvement of local control rates, but that in T-cell infiltration was not. T-cells infiltrated into tumor specifically in the patients with LC infiltration in both cell types. The authors suggest that the host anti-cancer immune response of individual patients may be remarkably different at the first step of antigen recognition by LC. The LC may induce T-cell-mediated antitumor response and improve local response in radiation therapy.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"cervical cancer\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"radiation therapy\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

The lesions treated were 49 epitheliomas of the esophageal opening, excluding hypopharyngeal tumors extending into the esophagus, and 15 epitheliomas of the remaining cervical segment of the esophagus. Survival did not exceed 2 years in any patient, and the reasons for these poor results are investigated. These included the particular selection of patients, the choice of radiotherapy as basic treatment, and the dosage administered. A new therapeutic approach is proposed based on pathologic findings and the various therapeutic measures available. Preoperative chemotherapy is followed by a total laryngopharyngectomy, with a total esophagectomy without opening the thorax and under certain well defined conditions. Continuity is re-established by a gastropharyngostomy, and postoperative radiotherapy is given routinely.

This report is confined to the 165 patients treated by radiation therapy (RT) only and focuses on the problem of relapse in the neck. A comparison is made between patients treated for the primary tumor with RT portals less than or equal to 30 cm2 and patients treated with larger field sizes. Sixty patients suffered a local recurrence, which was followed by a relapse in the neck in 13 patients. Nineteen patients experienced a relapse in the neck without a previous local failure. Five of these patients experienced a local failure at a later time. A multivariate analysis showed that the risk of a regional failure was significantly higher after a local failure and also for patients treated with small radiation portals (less than or equal to 30 cm2). Patients with an advanced tumor stage did not have a higher risk of a regional failure. A recurrence in the neck carried a poor survival; nearly two thirds of these patients died of their disease.

Evidence for favorable survival in patients with DNA diploid tumors.\nAbstract: Stage D1 disease is found in at least every sixth patient undergoing bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy and radical retropubic prostatectomy (RRP) for clinically localized prostate cancer (PC). Previous recommendations for monotherapy using surgery, radiation, or systemic therapy alone for Stage D1 disease have usually been associated with a poor outcome in regard to progression and survival. Unlike other pathologic stages, D1 disease treated with RRP is mainly related to DNA ploidy pattern in regard to all end points (progression and survival) and immediate adjuvant hormonal treatment (AHT) rather than to the usual pathologic variables, including the number of positive nodes. Complete DNA ploidy information was available in 370 patients with Stage D1 disease (age range, 40-77 years; mean, 64 years) undergoing RRP with or without AHT with a follow-up of up to 22 years (mean, 5 years). Overall, 80% of all DNA ploidy classes (diploid, 37%; tetraploid, 46%; and aneuploid, 17%) had AHT that highly significantly delayed progression for diploid (P less than 0.0001) more than tetraploid (P less than 0.0001) and more than aneuploid (P less than 0.0001) tumors. Significant prolongation of the disease-free interval might have improved the quality of life for tetraploid and aneuploid patients. Survival (crude and cause-specific) was significantly (P = 0.02) improved only for diploid patients who received AHT but not for tetraploid and aneuploid patients. This was due to the significantly accelerated death rate after progression in those patients with early AHT for tetraploid and aneuploid (but not diploid) tumors. Delayed (on progression only) AHT resulted in high progression rates for all DNA ploidy classes (aneuploid greater than tetraploid greater than diploid); e.g., 21 of 30 diploid patients progressed and 6 patients died from disease at a median of 31.5 months in spite of immediate hormone treatment on progression. RRP and AHT for patients with Stage D1 disease resulted in a highly significant delay in overall progression (76% at 10 years) and excellent local control, depending on DNA ploidy pattern (diploid greater than tetraploid greater than aneuploid) compared with a treatment regimen without AHT (24% overall nonprogression); only 20% of all patients with AHT are projected to die of disease at 10 years. Disease in diploid patients (37%) treated with AHT rarely progressed and those patients are unlikely to die of disease in 10 years or less; delayed (on progression) hormone treatment for diploid patients seemed ineffective. Inclusion of values for prostate specific antigen led to a higher failure rate on progression, and this is dependent on DNA ploidy class (diploid greater than tetraploid greater than aneuploid). Only patients with nondiploid tumors should be entered into prospective studies using innovative adjuvant treatment protocols to improve survival.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"prostate cancer\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"radical prostatectomy and adjuvant hormonal treatment\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

Following 40 Gy irradiation of the lower abdomen, treatment consisted of cystectomy or continued irradiation of the bladder region only. A full urological examination of the bladder established whether a patient was a responder or non-responder. The patients were divided into four groups: 27 responders treated with cystectomy and diversion; 48 responders treated with continued radiotherapy up to 65 Gy; 24 non-responders treated with cystectomy and diversion; 42 non-responders treated with continued radiotherapy up to 65 Gy. Survival and complications of treatment were compared with regard to category and grade of the tumours and sex and age of the patients. It was concluded that the responders who underwent cystectomy after 40 Gy irradiation survived longer than those who received a full course of radiotherapy. The responders had a better survival rate than non-responders, regardless of further treatment. Salvage cystectomy was rarely carried out and proved to be an unsatisfactory alternative, with a high operative risk and short survival.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"bladder cancer\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"radiotherapy\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

T1 and T2 cases represented 40% of the whole group and 40% of the patients presented clinically positive neck disease. This latter group had a significantly lower cure rate (42.8%) than the N0 patients (88.3%). Disease control depended also on the T stage: all 30 T1 and T2 lesions, 18/22 (81.8%) of the T3, and 6/17 (35.3%) of the T4 lesions were controlled. Cord fixation and early cartilage destruction were not a major obstacle for tumor control. Base of tongue involvement and especially the T4 and N3 association were indications of poor prognosis. Adenopathies smaller than 3 cm were controlled in 14/16 cases while nodes greater than or equal to 3 cm were controlled in 5/11 cases. Failures in neck nodes outside the treatment field were encountered in 7% of the cases but as the sole element of failure they represented 5.6%. Absolute survival at 3 years was 69.7% for the whole series while loco-regional control was 74.6%. No patient was salvaged by surgery. Three loco-regional recurrences occurred 3 years after the treatment.

Limited extra laryngeal extension especially to cartilage can still be controlled by irradiation. More advanced cases, especially the subcategory of T4 N3 patients, should have a multidisciplinary approach.

The present prospective study was to determine the influence of previous radiotherapy, widely used in the management of this tumour, on the accuracy of endosonography. A complete endosonographic examination was performed just before surgery in 40 patients with rectal cancer. Endosonographic and pathological staging were compared in group A, 21 patients without previous radiotherapy, and group B, 19 patients with preoperative radiotherapy. While the endosonographic accuracy for lymph node involvement was similar in the two groups (85 per cent compared with 84 per cent), wall invasion was correctly ascertained in 86 per cent in group A but in only 47 per cent in group B (P less than 0.05). After irradiation, the thickening of the rectal wall and the poor visualization of the hyperechoic layers hampered interpretation. Post-radiotherapy inflammation and/or fibrosis probably explained the echographic changes. Radiotherapy therefore altered endosonographic staging of rectal cancer.

About 1/2 had undifferentiated squamous epithelioma and the others moderately differentiated epthelioma. Radiotherapy consisted of intracavity radium of 5000 mg-hr. and an external telecobalt irradiation up to 4000 rad tumor dose through 4 portals. During and after radiotherapy patients were followed by clinical examiniations and vaginal smears. Months after beginning of treatment another cervical punch biopsy was done. The 3 year recovery rate was 97% of stage 1 but only 75% of stage 2 patients. Recovery seemed better in well differentiated epithelioma and in cases treated first with external radiation. There were 13 deaths from recurrent disease within 5 to 35 months after begining of treatment. Punch biopsies performed 4 months after beginning of treatment revealed carcinomatous tissue in the cervical area of only 2 of these 13 patients.

All eight patients demonstrated a continuous rise in the absolute number of neutrophils, eosinophils, and monocytes over the first four weeks of therapy. Bone marrow examination revealed a progressive increase in bone marrow cellularity in all patients except one. An increase in myeloid: erythroid ratio was seen with progressive maturation of granulocytic cells. Neutrophilic and eosinophilic myelocytes were the most prominent cells. The percentage of myeloblasts and promyelocytes did not increase significantly, and the proportions of postmitotic granulocytic cells did not change either. No significant morphologic changes were noted in the basophilic, erythroid, and megakaryocytic series. The most prominent topographic observation in the bone marrow during GM-CSF therapy was the frequent clustering of myeloid cells close to the bone trabeculae. The periosteal localization of myeloid precursors may reflect a higher concentration of stem cells and/or stromal cells in the bone marrow adjacent to the bone trabeculae or a higher concentration of growth factors.

Initially, patients with NCD and EH, stage IB, showed hyperkinetic circulation, and those with EH, stage IIA, had hypokinetic circulation.

In fact, while the air released by the alveolar baro-trauma can, once a given pressure is exceeded, migrate into the retroperitoneum and produce a non-surgical pneumascos (for which the other possible causes are far more exceptional, and rather are unpleasant surprises, such as this orogenital induced PPT in Gantt's female patient, conversely the pressurized air from true ruptures of intraabdominal hollow organs may migrate into the mediastinum and cause a thoracic air leakage syndrome that perfectly simulates this pulmonary baro-trauma. Therefore all the paraclinical means required must be used to confirm--or rule out--this diagnosis of perforation, which demands emergency surgery. However, if there is any doubt, the consensus is that emergency surgery is recommended as it is better to accept blank laparotomy than to oversee a gastrointestinal rupture with all its severe complications of evolution.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"severe blunt injuries\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"respiratory or cardiorespiratory resuscitation\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

One patient died after operation from myocardial infarction; and one patient went abroad. The healing course of the remaining 97 fractures is described, classified according to the type of fracture and the accuracy of operative reduction. Seventy-five fractures had a normal time to union, defined as the lasting achievement of full weight-bearing within 4 months. In 7 fractures the healing period was moderately delayed (full weight-bearing being achieved in 4-6 months) and in 5 it was seriously delayed, requiring 6-11 months after injury. Nonunion occurred in 4 cases and refracture in 6 cases. Osteitis developed in 2 cases and was successfully treated with antibiotics within 6 weeks. A second internal fixation was necessary in 12 patients. In 5 patients a plaster cast was applied to treat delayed union. Amputation was necessary in a 75-year-old man with senile dementia who developed infection after a second operation for refracture. One patient still has a pseudarthrosis after 2 years and 2 further operations. In the other 95 fractures union was the end-result. Of the 21 comminuted and open fractures only 13 healed within 4 months. We recommend a different approach in the treatment of badly comminuted and open 'high-energy' fractures. With this reservation, we find that the method of rigid internal fixation which we employ has given satisfactory early results.

Therefore, it is postulated that patients with high grade lesions, even though stage A, undergo more aggressive therapy. It also was found that extensive segmental resection, even though necessitating ureteroneocystostomy, resulted in a favorable 5-year survival rate.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"bladder cancer\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"segmental resection\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

Following sigmoid colectomy and descending colostomy, a catheter was inserted from the right gastroepiploic artery to the proper hepatic artery. From the day of surgery 5-Fluorouracil was administered in doses of 250 mg/day continuously through a catheter over the 2-month period of hospitalization. After the patient was discharged, 250 mg/day of 5-Fluorouracil was administered at home using Vaxter Infusor according to a regimen of 10-day continuous infusion and subsequent 4-day rest. Five months after the initial operation, the serum CEA level decreased dramatically, and CT scan of the liver revealed the complete disappearance of the metastases.

In Japan it has long been common knowledge that the ingestion of green tea should be avoided before and after the intake of iron preparations. There have recently been some reports, however, that deny the effect of green tea on iron preparations. A study was conducted on pregnant patients with anemia, using sodium ferrous citrate (Ferromia). The drug was administered to a group of patients taking green tea and a group taking water. Our results can be summarized as follows. 1. Hemoglobin, serum iron and total iron binding capacity were markedly improved after the administration of the iron preparation, and there was no difference between these parameters in the two groups of patients. 2. There was a tendency for patients with hypochromia to show a more marked improvement in hemoglobin in both groups. 3. Anemia cured in 96.7% of patients in the green tea group and in 93.4% of patients in the water group after the oral administration of the iron preparation. 4. The incidence of side effects stood at 18.3% for the green tea group and 21.9% for the water group, there being no significant difference. No serious side effects were elicited in the present study.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"iron deficiency anemia with pregnancy\", \"Symptoms\": [\"anemia\"], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"sodium ferrous citrate\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

The criteria of inclusion in the study were: angina grade IV, resistant to drug therapy and without indication of surgery. The mean follow-up period was 9.8 +/- 8.2 months. A significant reduction in the weekly number of anginal attacks (preoperative 30.9 +/- 14.5; postoperative 9.6 +/- 8.2; p less than 0.01); improvement in functional class (p less than 0.001), and significant improvement (p greater than 0.05) in the pain, energy, sleep, social isolation and emotional reactions areas of NHP were observed. It was concluded that SCES is a useful procedure in patients with unstable angina untreatable by other medical or surgical methods, as it reduces the number of anginal attacks and increases quality of life of the patients without additional risk.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"unstable angina\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"spinal cord electrical stimulation\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

This surgical procedure was used if gynecomastia was classified from stage 1 to stage 2B. Cosmetic reasons were the major reasons for operation in 70% of the patients. The most common late postoperative sequelae were inverted areolae and hypaesthesiae of the areolar region. When operation was carried out, half of the patients were overweight. The remainder were of normal weight. Among the patients, who were overweight time of operation, 2/3 found that the cosmetic correction was unsatisfactory. In the \"normal weight group\" 2/3 were satisfied with the cosmetic result. The patients in the dissatisfied group found that too little tissue had been removed from the area. The operation is carried out through a little infraareolar incision. Because of this, it is technically difficult, especially in patients with considerable subcutaneous tissue. On this background, we find that Webster's method alone, not should be used as surgical treatment of gynecomastia in overweight patients.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"gynecomastia\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"subcutaneous mastectomy using Webster's method\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

Hemiballism is a benign condition with spontaneous recovery in most cases, but hemiballism caused by lesions outside the subthalamic nucleus is reported to tend to persist for a long term. In our case without involvement of the subthalamic nucleus, hemiballism so far continued for three months since the onset. Successful pharmacological treatments of ballism with haloperidol or phenothiazines were well known. In our case, the treatments of ballism with these drugs were unsuccessful due to drug-induced hepatic dysfunction.

Case report.\nAbstract: The authors report a case in which an enlarging skull fracture was surgically repaired on the fourth day after the initial injury. A 5-month-old boy fell from his father's arms and was hospitalized with a large, irregular protrusion in the left parieto-occipital region and right hemiparesis. Plain skull films showed a diastatic linear fracture with a maximum width of 8 mm, which expanded to 11 mm by the fourth day. Computed tomography (CT) scans revealed a cerebral contusion just beneath the fracture as well as a left subdural effusion. At operation, the contused brain tissue was found to have herniated over the bone defect. Craniotomy revealed a large dural defect, which was repaired with lyophilized dura. The patient was discharged with no neurological deficit. On the basis of a review of 58 recently reported cases of skull fracture, the authors conclude that the following conditions warrant consideration of early surgery: 1) a diastatic skull fracture with a width of at least 4 mm; 2) CT demonstration of a cerebral contusion beneath the fracture; 3) overlying scalp swelling; and 4) a neurological abnormality contralateral to the fracture. Performing surgery before the fracture gap becomes scalloped will result in more rapid neurological recovery and reduce the likelihood of enlargement of the fracture.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"skull fracture\", \"Symptoms\": [\"irregular protrusion in the left parieto-occipital region\", \"right hemiparesis\"], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"surgery\", \"CureRate\": \"1.0\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [\"computed tomography (CT)\"], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

Surgical treatment for thyrotoxicosis was selected as the treatment of choice in 179 patients (9.8%), 86 with toxic diffuse goiter (TDG), 21 with toxic nodular goiter (TNG) and 40 with toxic adenoma (TA). The presence of thyroid cancer was found in 11 patients for a total incidence of 6.1%. Six patients had TDG (percent incidence in this group 6.9%), 4 patients had TNG (7.5%) and 1 had TA (2.5%). While the presence of thyroid cancer was totally unsuspected in TNG and TA, in TDG 4 out of 6 patients found to have a cancer, had been suspected before surgery. When a thyroid nodule was present in a toxic diffuse goiter the possibility to face with a malignant lesion reached 22.2% of the cases (4 out of 18 cases), while only 2 out of 68 patients (2.9%) with TDG and no nodule had thyroid cancer. These results confirm recent other series reporting the frequent association of hyperthyroidism and thyroid cancer and suggest that in thyrotoxic patients any nodule must be screened carefully to rule out malignancy.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"thyroid cancer\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"surgery\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

Comprehensive analyses of blood and urinary steroids showed that although the steroid profiles differed between patients, the pattern in each patient remained almost constant as the disease progressed, or remitted due to therapy. Elevations of serum testosterone and oestradiol were commensurate with the extent of virilisation, and the urinary output of aldosterone was associated with the severity of hypertension. A new finding was that all had substantially increased urinary free deoxycorticosterone. Complete surgical removal of the primary tumours was impossible but when most of the tumour tissue was removed, full clinical and biochemical remissions were obtained for a short time in 2 patients. One patient obtained a clinical and biochemical remission from op'DDD. In another patient the drug caused reduction both in blood pressure and in urinary aldosterone excretion, but there were unpleasant side effects. A third patient could not tolerate op'DDD. Metyrapone therapy produced neither clinical nor biochemical improvement in 3 patients. The mean duration of survival was 17 months after the first symptoms and 10 months from the date of operation. Despite advances in drug therapy, adrenal cortical carcinoma remains a lethal disease. Biochemical screening of multiple steroids offers a means of early diagnosis and disease monitoring.

Analysis of 40 patients treated by the same surgeon.\nAbstract: Forty patients with acute ruptures of the Achilles tendon were treated surgically by the same physician (T.B.Q.) during a period of 1947 to 1971. The average followup was 19 years. Ninety percent of the patients were men (average age 37.5 years) who were engaged in recreational sport activities. The majority denied a physical conditioning program. The acute ruptures were treated by a surgical procedure which consisted of a 15-cm incision on the medial aspect of the tendon with either the plantaris muscle being woven through the Achilles tendon in a clockwise fashion or a pull-out wire, supplemented with silk mattress sutures, being used to repair the ruptured tendon. The wound was closed and the patient's leg was immobilized. The wire was removed at 6 weeks. The rehabilitation plan consisted of ambulation with a heel lift and elastic stocking (the height of the lift was gradually reduced) and toe exercises. The patients began walking downstairs backwards at 3 months and continued exercises until full range of motion was attained. Subjectively, the results were excellent as graded by the patients. Objectively, there were some minor deficits but they did not impede the overall function. On a scale of 1 (poor) to 4 (excellent), the clinical results were rated excellent (42%), good (36%), fair (15%), and poor (6%).

A simple gross excision of the tumor provides the best cosmetic result, but a wide local resection may be important to prevent local recurrence in some patients. In order to identify patients who are not adequately treated by gross excision of the tumor and radiation therapy, we performed a retrospective clinical-pathologic review of 221 treated women with infiltrating duct carcinoma. There were 53 cases in which the excision specimen showed a constellation of three pathologic features: prominent intraductal carcinoma in the tumor, intraductal carcinoma in the grossly-normal adjacent tissue, and poorly-differentiated nuclei. These cases had a 37% risk of a local recurrence at 6 years compared to eight per cent for all other cases (p less than 0.0001). In cases with all three features, the use of a supplemental dose of radiation to the primary site did not significantly reduce the risk of a local recurrence. Local recurrence at 6 years was 34% in cases with all three features, who received supplemental local radiation, compared to 49% in cases not receiving a supplemental dose (p = 0.28). Survival was also worse for patients with all three features compared to other cases (69% vs. 90% at 6 years, p = 0.002). These results indicate that patients with all three pathologic features have a high risk of local recurrence following gross excision of the tumor and radiation therapy. If primary radiation therapy is selected for these patients, they should first undergo a re-excision of the tumor site in order to be certain that areas of extensive intraductal carcinoma have been adequately resected. Patients whose tumors do not show all three features are adequately treated by gross excision of the tumor prior to radiation therapy.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"breast cancer\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"surgical resection\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

Of the 150 patients, 103 suffered from pleomorphic rhabdomyosarcomas, 40 patients had embryonal rhabdomyosarcomas, and 7 had alveolar cell type of rhabdomyosarcoma. The males suffered almost twice as much as the females from this form of cancer (96 males to 54 females). The fifth decade had the highest incidence of all rhabdomyosarcomas. The younger patients generally suffered from embryonal rhabdomyosarcomas and the older ones from pleomorphic rhabdomyosarcomas, although age was no barrier to the occurrence of embryonal rhabdomyosarcomas in some of the older patients and pleomorphic rhabdomyosarcomas in some of the younger patients. Caucasians were almost exclusively afflicted by this form of cancer (93% of this series). The lower extremity was the most frequent site of the lesion, occurring in 50.7% of the 150 cases. The upper extremity was the second most frequently involved site (28%), and the trunk was the least involved site (21.3%). Of the 150 patients studied, 40 were considered indeterminate. Thirteen patients are alive and free of cancer, but were treated less than 5 years ago; 12 patients reported for consultation only. There were 13 who were free of sarcomas at periods in excess of 2 years but were lost to follow-up. Two patients in this series died before the 5-year period, and autopsy revealed the death to be due to causes other than the rhabdomyosarcoma. Of the 110 determinate patients, 75 (68%) died as a result of the cancer. The 5-year survival rate equals 32%. The fact of the 30% 5-year survival after treatment for recurrences should help dismiss the pessimism which prevails once a recurrence is noted subsequent to major therapy. Age per se had no great effect on prognosis. The poorest results occurred in the 11-20 age range, with a 5-year survival of 15%. This value reflects on increased incidence of embryonal rhabdomyosarcomas which tend to be more malignant and metastasize earlier than do the pleomorphic type. The effect of location upon survival revealed that of 76 patients with involvement of the lower extremity, 34% survived 5 years or longer, and those with sarcomas of the trunk had the poorest survival (26%).

She became ileus and an emergency operation was consequently performed. A histological examination of the abdominal tumor indicated proliferation of undifferentiated lymphoblasts with intermingled histiocytes so called \"starry sky appearance\". The diagnosis was Burkitt's lymphoma. On the 4th post-operative day, a cardiac tamponade became evident. The pericardial effusion contained many lymphoblasts and the diagnosis was pericarditis due to the invasion of lymphoma cells. The pericarditis was successfully treated by infusion of doxycycline into the pericardial space following drainage. The patient responded to systemic chemotherapy with complete remission. 7 courses of systemic chemotherapy along with intrathecal infusions for CNS prophylaxis were subsequently carried out. A state of complete remission has continued for more than 13 months. Cardiac tamponade accompanied by Burkitt's lymphoma is quite rare and has not ever been reported in Japan in our knowledge. The efficacy of surgical treatment before systemic chemotherapy and the series of intrathecal infusions for CNS prophylaxis was demonstrated in this case.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"burkitt's lymphoma\", \"Symptoms\": [\"abdominal mass\", \"ileus\", \"cardiac tamponade\"], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"surgical resection and chemotherapy\", \"CureRate\": \"1.0\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [\"histological examination\"], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

She had discovered the tumor two years previously, but had never visited any medical institution. She was diagnosed as advanced breast cancer with multiple lung metastases, bone metastasis, and both supraclavicular lymph node metastases by physical examination, fine needle aspiration cytology, chest X-P, and bone scintigraphy. Incisional biopsy, performed to confirm the histological type of breast cancer and to evaluate estrogen and progesterone receptor (ER and PgR) status, revealed solid-tubular carcinoma. Both ER and PgR were highly positive at 322.6 and 228.0 fmol/mg protein, respectively. Therefore, endocrine therapy was chosen to treat this advanced breast cancer patient, although she had multiple organ metastases. Twenty mg of Tamoxifen a day was administered per os. After treatment with tamoxifen, the size of ulceration started to decreased and the dyspnea caused by multiple lung metastases was reduced. Eight weeks after, she showed partial response (PR) determined from the size of the ulceration and chest X-P. She has been maintaining PR for more than 9 months. Thus, Tamoxifen was shown to be very effective for this case of advanced breast cancer with multiple organ metastases.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"breast cancer\", \"Symptoms\": [\"giant ulcerated left breast tumor\"], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"tamoxifen\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"20 mg tamoxifen daily\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [\"physical examination,fine needle aspiration cytology,chest X-P,bone scintigraphy,Incisional biopsy\"], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

Aortography revealed fusiform, calcified aneurysm of the infrarenal abdominal aorta and severe stenosis of right common iliac artery. CT scan demonstrated a soft tissue density structure around the aortic aneurysm which was enhanced after contrast medium injection. At surgery, the aneurysm had a thick, firm, smooth wall which was shiny white in appearance and adherent perianeurysmal fibrosis was marked. In order to avoid injury to surrounding tissue such as the duodenum or vena cava, thrombo-exclusion method was chosen. Histological examination of the aneurysmal wall showed fibrous tissue infiltrated with mononuclear cells such as lymphocytes and plasma cells.

The present study verifies the value of negative predischarge exercise testing in identifying low-risk patients treated with thrombolysis after AMI. One hundred fifty-seven consecutive patients with an uncomplicated clinical course underwent maximal or symptom-limited exercise testing (Bruce treadmill protocol) within 15 days of AMI in the absence of therapy. The location of the AMI was anterior in 51 patients, inferior in 85 and non-Q-wave in 21. All of the patients were followed for 6 months. Death and nonfatal reinfarction were considered as major coronary events, and the recurrence of angina as a minor event. Exercise test results were negative in 105 patients (group 1) and positive for angina or ST depression greater than or equal to 0.1 mV in 52 (group 2). No deaths occurred during follow-up; there were 3 reinfarctions (3%) and 7 cases (7%) of postinfarction angina in group 1, and 2 reinfarctions (4%) and 21 cases (40%) of postinfarction angina in group 2. By the end of follow-up, 90% of the patients with negative exercise test results were event-free (97% in the case of major events). These results show that thrombolytic therapy does not affect the value of negative postinfarction exercise testing in identifying low-risk patients.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"acute myocardial infarction\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"thrombolysis\", \"CureRate\": \"0.9\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

The authors describe a patient with optic nerve infiltration by acute promyelocytic leukemia documented ophthalmoscopically and confirmed by standardized echography and magnetic resonance imaging. High-resolution chromosome banding revealed the patient had a 15;17 chromosomal translocation known to be associated with acute promyelocytic leukemia. Treatment was instituted with oral all trans-retinoic acid without adjuvant radiotherapy or intrathecal chemotherapy. Results of serial bone marrow examination showed progressive differentiation of malignant cells with complete bone marrow remission. Results of serial ophthalmic examinations showed complete resolution of the leukemic optic nerve head infiltration.

She had bilateral papilledema and slight increase in CSF pressure (175mmH2O) with normal visual acuity and field. Neurological and hormonal examination were normal except for over response of PRL and TSH to TRH test. The sella was enlarged and MRI and metrizamide CT demonstrated intrasellar CSF filling with remodeling of the pituitary gland. The patient was diagnosed as primary empty sella syndrome associated with benign intracranial hypertension. The complaints did not subside for six months. The patient was treated via the transsphenoidal approach.

Excessively elevated plasma ACTH concentrations and radiological evidence of sella turcica deformation led to the diagnosis of ACTH-producing adenomas and prompted their removal by transsphenoidal microsurgery. In one patient, a large Crooke's cell adenoma with extensive extrasellar expansion had caused severe and irreversible bilateral defects of the visual fields and unilateral optic atrophy. Surgical removal of the tumour and radiotherapy brought about a permanent disappearance of the hyperpigmentation, but eventually led to secondary hypothyroidism. In the second patients, the selective removal of a small intrasellar eosinophilic adenoma consisting of ACTH-producing cells did not alleviate the hyperpigmentation and did not lower the plasma ACTH concentration. However, hyperpigmentation regressed markedly within a year of treatment with a higher dose of cortisone. The rarity of similar cases in the literature seems to indicate that insufficient feedback suppression of ACTH-producing cells in treated Addison's disease does not by itself induce the development of a pituitary adenoma, but might promote the growth of an independently and coincidentally occurring microadenoma, which would have caused Cushing's disease in a person with intact adrenal glands.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"addison's disease\", \"Symptoms\": [\"progressive hyperpigmentation\", \"bilateral defects of the visual fields\", \"unilateral optic atrophy\", \"secondary hypothyroidism\"], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"transsphenoidal microsurgery\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [\"plasma ACTH concentrations,radiological evidence of sella turcica deformation\"], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

He had been diagnosed as having ventricular septal defect (VSD) at the age of 6 years. When he was hospitalized, he was in a condition of class IV by NYHA classification, with a white blood cell count of 17,300/mm3, an increase in CRP, a red blood cell sedimentation rate of 108 mm/hr, and positive alpha-streptococcus in blood culture. His cardiothoracic ratio was 64% with signs of pulmonary congestion on a chest X-ray film. Echocardiography revealed the presence of VSD and huge vegetations on the tricuspid, mitral and aortic valves. He was considered to have active infective endocarditis (AIE) which had presumably been provoked by VSD and the tooth removal. Penicillin G at a daily dose of 20 million units and gentamicin at a daily dose of 80 mg were intravenously administered to treat the alpha-streptococcus infection for about 4 weeks. Furosemide was used for congestive heart failure. Since, although his cardiac function appeared to have been improved, the signs and symptoms of the infection persisted, triple valve replacement for the tricuspid, mitral and aortic valves and patch closure of the VSD were performed 4 weeks after the hospitalization. The operation revealed inflammatory lesions extending from the endocardium of the right ventricle to the mitral valves through the VSD, and huge vegetations on the tricuspid, mitral and aortic valves.

In a series of 15 consecutive patients with large cerebellopontine angle tumors, all of which were more than 2.5 cm in diameter, tumor excision was performed by a one-stage combined middle fossa-translabyrinthine approach. There were 13 acoustic neuromas, 10 of which were more than 4 cm in diameter, one petrous apex meningioma 4 cm in diameter, and one facial neuroma 3 cm in diameter. The tumors were totally removed in all 15 patients. The facial nerve was preserved in 12 of 13 evaluable patients. In the 14th patient the nerve had been transected in a previous suboccipital procedure with incomplete removal, and in the 15th patient the nerve was sutured following excision of a facial neuroma. Thus, the nerve was lost at surgery in only one patient. This combined approach provided very clear visualization of the cerebellopontine angle, including the brain stem and the lower cranial nerves. It enabled identification of both the origin of the facial nerve at the brain stem and the lateral segment of the nerve in the internal auditory canal. Anterior extensions of tumor growing through the tentorial hiatus were easily removed. The results in these 15 patients show that this approach is excellent for total removal of large acoustic neuromas with preservation of the facial nerve. It is especially suitable for large tumors with anterior extensions.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"large acoustic neuromas\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"tumor excision\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

The authors studied 29 patients with CSH treated by VVI pacing over a period of 10 years. The average follow-up was 34 months (range 6 to 96 months). Three of the 27 patients (11%) who were asymptomatic at the outset continued to have symptoms. The nature of the CSH was well-defined in 25 patients; 19 of the 20 cases of cardio-inhibitory CSH and 4 of the 5 cases of mixed CSH were asymptomatic. These two poor clinical results were analysed: the patient with the cardio-inhibitory CSH (one recurrence in 84 months) had a drop of 40 mmHg in systolic blood pressure which fulfilled criteria of the cardio-inhibitory form of CSH (a drop of 30 to 50 mmHg). The second case was a complete therapeutic failure with 3 recurrent syncopal episodes. The patient had a mixed form of CSH (B.P. drop of 65 mmHg) associated with a \"pace maker syndrome\" (drop of 50 mmHg in systolic blood pressure at the onset of VVI pacing without any sino carotid massage).

The diagnosis was suspected on clinical examination and documented by culture of the vitreous biopsy obtained during vitrectomy. The endophthalmitis was treated by pars plana vitrectomy and intravitreous injection of amphotericin B and dexamethasone.

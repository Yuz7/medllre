Proliferation of the cells was triggered by medium conditioned by acute myelocytic leukemic cells exposed to 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol 13-acetate (TPA). The medium was designated as TPA-treated cell conditioned medium (TPACCM). The cycle of events in fetal bone marrow cell culture began with a sharp decrease in the total number of cells. At this juncture a predominance of primitive macrophage-like cells positive for macrophage markers was present in the culture. The process of multiplication began with rapid proliferation of promyelocytes. Simultaneous proliferation of granulocyte-macrophage (GM) colony forming cells (CFC) indicated that at least some of the promyelocytes might act like CFC. The absolute number of committed CFC then increased 5-11 fold, the number that approximated a total multiplication of FBM cells. The proliferation continued with the culture containing some blast cells and showing simultaneous differentiation of the cells into mature granulocytes and macrophages. The cells with macrophage markers persisted throughout the culture period. To determine more precise definition of the role of primitive macrophages and promyelocytes in FBM cell multiplication, experiments with purified fractions of these cells have to be done. TPACCM purification and isolation of active substances is also suggested. These investigations might result in obtaining a pool of BM cells in vitro suitable for BM transplantation.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol 13-acetate (TPA)\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}], "completion": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"multiplication of human fetal myelomonocytic precursors in medium conditioned by acute myelocytic leukemia cells treated by 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol 13-acetate (TPA)\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"proliferation of myeloid cells and macrophages\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}\n\n"}

Until recently, the only effective form of the drug available in Australia has been pitressin tannate in oil. This often has to be given as a daily injection, which, like all intramuscular injections, is painful and, being in an oily base, is particularly likely to result in abscess formation.

Their ages ranged from 2 to 65 years and postoperative follow-up ranged from 6 to 40 months. Leksell's stereotactic technique was employed to determine coordinates by CAT. Cyst volume was quantified both geometrically and isotopically with 99Tc, values differing by 7%. Dosimetry was determined by applying the formula developed by Loevinger et al., and 20,000 rads were administered throughout to the cystic wall. All 17 patients, except for 4 children, had previously received surgery, shunts or radiotherapy, alone or combined. In 4 cases, 90Y injection was the only treatment, while in 6, the cyst was evacuated at 10 days following radiocolloid injection. Skull and spinal column gamma chamber studies were carried out on all patients at 24, 48, and 72 hours post injection, but no isotope leakage could be detected. The patients returned to normal activities except one with multiple cysts who died. There were no changes in the endocrinologic profile. In one case, a decrease in visual acuity 18 months after treatment, improved following corticoid administration.

VP-16-213 was given on relapse. Response rate and survival were analyzed according to extent of tumor, presence of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone production (SIADH), and, in 38 patients, size of intrathoracic tumor as measured by computerized tomographic (CT) scanning. The median survival of the entire group was 34.6 weeks. In patients with limited disease the median survival was 46 weeks compared to 29 weeks for those with extensive disease. This difference in survival between patients with limited and extensive disease was most marked in those showing a partial response (median survival, 45.9 and 28 weeks, respectively). Patients with ectopic antidiuretic hormone production had a poor prognosis even if they had achieved a complete response. Only one partial response to VP-16-213 occurred. There was a strong correlation between initial intrathoracic tumor size as assessed by total cross-sectional area on CT scan and response and survival. When the total area exceeded 30 cm2 there were no complete responders, but there were complete responses in eight of 21 patients when the area was less than 30 cm2. The relationship between intrathoracic tumor size and response rate was present when analyzed according to disease extent, age, sex, and performance status. A clear relationship between total tumor area and survival was also found. When SCCB is treated with chemotherapy alone, the prognosis is better for those patients who present with limited disease, without SIADH, and with small intrathoracic tumor. In this group it is possible that further intensification of therapy may result in prolonged survival.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"small cell carcinoma of the bronchus\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"a combination of cyclophosphamide, methotrexate with calcium leucovorin rescue, and lomustine (CCNU).\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}], "completion": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"small cell carcinoma of the bronchus\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"chemotherapy\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}\n\n"}

Twenty-two were infected and 21 were refractory to random platelet transfusions at the time of admission. All were given marrow grafts from HLA-identical siblings. Forty-five were conditioned for grafting by cyclophosphamide (CY), 50 mg/kg on each of 4 successive days, and four by 1000 rad total body irradiation. All were given intermittent methotrexate therapy within the first 100 days of grafting to modify graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Three patients died from infection too early to evaluate (days 1-8). Forty-six had marrow engraftment. Of these, 20 are surviving with good peripheral blood counts between 186 and 999 days, and 18 have returned to normal activities. Chronic GCHD is a problem in five. Twelve patients died of infection following rejection of the marrow graft. Twelve patients died with bacterial or fungal infections or interstitial pneumonia and active GVHD or soon following resolution of GVHD. Two patients died with marrow engraftment and no GVHD, one with an interstitial, and the other with a bacterial pneumonia. Thirty-six patients who had received random donor blood transfusions were randomly assigned to receive either CY or procarbazine-antithymocyte globulin-CY as conditioning regimens to test whether the incidence of graft rejection could be decreased. There was no difference in the incidence of graft rejection between the two regimens. In 13 patients with rejection, second transplants were attempted either with the original marrow donor (9 patients) or another HLA-identical sibling (4 patients). Three of these transplants were not evaluable, seven were unsuccessful and three were successful with only one of the three surviving for more than 468 days. In conclusion, the long-term survival of 41% of the patients in the present study is similar to that achieved in our first 24 patients, and confirms the importance of marrow transplantation for the treatment of severe aplastic anemia.

Of the 28 patients, 21 were in chronic phase, five were in accelerated phase and two were in blast phase at the time of BMT. Twenty-three of the patients survived more than 63-2187 days after BMT, 21 in continuous complete remission and two with haematologic relapse of CML. Two patients died of interstitial pneumonitis and one died of relapsed CML, cerebral aspergillosis and cytomegalovirus enterocolitis. The overall probability of survival at six years was 78% +/- 9% (mean +/- standard error) and of disease free survival 66 +/- 11%. For patients transplanted in chronic phase, the survival probability was 90 +/- 6%, while all of the patients undergoing BMT in chronic phase within the first year after diagnosis were alive with a relapse-free survival of 88 +/- 12%. The actuarial probability of occurrence of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was 57 +/- 9%, while for Grades II and III GVHD it was 28 +/- 9%. Chronic GVHD occurred in 18 of 25 patients at risk. The majority of patients had a Karnofsky performance score at latest follow-up of at least 90% (range 50-100).

The goals of the combined procedure were to increase correction of the curve and decrease the rate of pseudarthrosis. Preoperatively, the major curves measured an average of 83 degrees, and on the best side-bend they averaged 59 degrees, a 29 per cent degree of flexibility. At the time of discharge from the hospital the curves had improved to an average of 44 degrees, a correction of the preoperative curve of 39 degrees or 47 per cent. At an average length of follow-up of forty-nine months, the major curves measured an average of 50 degrees, a 41 per cent correction compared with the initial curves. Twenty-three of the major curves were better than when they were measured on the preoperative radiograph of the best side-bend, by an average of 15 degrees, but eight curves were either the same or worse.

We studied the progression of the kyphosis and evaluated the function and fate of the bone grafts that were used. At eight years, the results with respect to the progression of the kyphosis were classified as excellent or good in forty-eight patients (59 per cent), all of whom had had minimum destruction of the vertebral bodies; limited surgical excision of bone, resulting in a small post-debridement defect that needed only a short graft; marked intraoperative correction of the deformity; and involvement of lower lumbar segments. Fifteen patients (19 per cent) had a fair result and eighteen (22 per cent), a poor result. An increase in the deformity was common in patients who had extensive involvement of the vertebral bodies that had resulted in a large post-debridement defect necessitating a graft spanning more than two disc spaces. Lesions of the thoracic vertebrae were associated with many of the poor results, and patients who had a marked kyphosis before treatment also did not do well. A stable graft that provided structural support was observed in only thirty-three patients (41 per cent), and failure of the graft due to slippage, fracture, absorption, or subsidence was seen in forty-eight patients (59 per cent). The length of the graft also played a role: the graft failed most often in patients in whom it spanned more than two disc spaces. We concluded that it is unwise to rely solely on the graft to prevent vertebral collapse in patients in whom the length of the graft exceeds two disc spaces. These patients may benefit from additional measures, such as an extended period of non-weight-bearing, posterior arthrodesis after six to twelve weeks, and prolonged use of a brace until complete consolidation is evident.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"tuberculosis of the spine\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"anterior arthrodesis\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}], "completion": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"tuberculosis of the spine\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"debridment and anterior arthrodesis\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}\n\n"}

All patients with peritonitis mounted a CRP response, and the height of the response correlated well with the severity and extent of the peritoneal damage. Patients who recovered uneventfully after antimicrobial treatment showed a prompt fall in CRP from its peak value towards normal. In contrast, each patient in whom the serum CRP value remained raised after antimicrobial treatment had a complicated course. During routine outpatient follow up the serum CRP value remained within the normal range in the absence of intercurrent complications. These results, together with the commercial availability of rapid and precise assays for CRP, indicate that serial CRP measurements may be useful in monitoring the efficacy of antimicrobial treatment during episodes of peritonitis and in the recognition of intercurrent complications in patients undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"peritonitis\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"antimicrobial treatment\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [\"serum C-reactive protein concentration measurement\"], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}], "completion": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"serum c-reactive protein concentration in the management of infection in patients treated by continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"serum C-reactive protein (CRP) concentration was measured serially\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}\n\n"}

Sixty-one patients had neural involvement at the time of admission, 42 of them an incomplete or complete paraplegia. All patients were treated by triple-drug chemotherapy. Chemotherapy and bed rest alone was sufficient for 76 patients. Surgical intervention was indicated in 132 cases. Debridement was carried out in 33 cases, debridement and spinal fusion was performed in 18 cases, anterolateral decompression of the spinal cord alone was employed in 15 cases, and together with spinal fusion recommended in 15 cases. Minor surgical procedures were made necessary in 8 cases. The indications for surgery were: (1) unfavorable response to conservative treatment during 3 months, (2) Pott's paraplegia showing no signs of recovery by conservative treatment, (3) Pott's paraplegia developing during conservative treatment (4) cases with unstable spinal lesions, and (5) cases with paravertebral abscesses and sinuses. Complete or good recovery occurred in 61 out of 76 conservatively treated patients. Forty-two out of 61 patients with neural involvement made a complete or a good recovery, 31 being patients with paraplegia. No improvement was noted in 16 cases with neural involvement, and 2 had progression of the neurological signs.

She had no history of trauma to the calf, and family history was negative for muscle disease. Physical examination showed an enlarged left calf muscle with pain which was evoked by stretching of the Achilles tendon. There was no muscle weakness or neurological abnormality. Laboratory tests were all within normal limits, including erythrocyte sedimentation rate and serum enzymes such as creatine kinase and aldolase. The CT scan revealed an isolated round-shaped low density area in the left calf muscle, which showed up as a markedly high signal intensity on T2 weighted images of MRI. The lesion was confirmed to be the lateral head of the gastrocnemius muscle. The specimen obtained from the affected muscle demonstrated degenerative and inflammatory changes together with excess fibrosis. There was no sarcoid lesion or malignancy. From the above results, the present case was thought to have isolated focal myositis. Prednisolone 80 mg (40 mg, twice, at 4-day intervals) was given to the left femoral artery without any trouble. Thereafter the patient became free from pain and difficulty in walking, and the lesion demonstrated by CT scan disappeared in 15 days. However, the high signal intensity on T2 weighted images faintly remained until the 54th day after the treatment.

A total of 25 patients received combined treatment with bacillus Calmette-Guerin and interleukin-2 at weekly instillations for 6 consecutive weeks and then monthly for 1 year. T antigen expression in all patients was studied before treatment. Of the patients 16 had positive T antigen expression in the tumors: 13 (81%) remained free of tumor for an average of 28 months, 3 had a noninvasive recurrence each at 8 to 27 months (mean 18 months) and all responded well to a repeated treatment cycle. Nine patients were negative for T antigen: 1 (11%) remained free of tumor for 11 months, while 8 had recurrence within 12 months. Of the latter 8 patients 2 had noninvasive recurrence each at 4 to 5 months but they responded to a repeated treatment cycle and remained free of tumor for 4 to 22 months (mean 13 months), 4 had subsequent repeated recurrences at 12 to 41 months (mean 22 months) and 2 had progression to deep invasion resulting in cystectomy at 11 to 12 months. Thus, the disease-free rate (continuous complete response) in patients with tumors positive for T antigen was 81%, while that in patients with tumors negative for T antigen was 11% (p less than 0.005, chi-square test). The over-all response rate in patients with positive and negative tumors to bacillus Calmette-Guerin and interleukin-2 treatment was 100 and 33%, respectively, and that for the total patients was 76%.

Overall, six patients underwent surgery without untoward events and six had repeat PBAV. Only two out of six patients with repeat PBAV had sustained improvement; one was referred to surgery and the remaining three died soon after the second PBAV. One- and 2-year survival were respectively 72 and 62% and percentage of survivors with persistent improvement 68 and 41%. Although aortic valve area after PBAV was associated with outcome, predictors of poor long-term prognosis were primarily related to the pre-operative haemodynamic status.

The patient was successfully treated with a left superficial temporal artery to middle cerebral artery bypass followed by balloon entrapment of the aneurysm. There have been at least 40 previously reported cases of aneurysms of the petrous portion of the carotid artery. These aneurysms can be mycotic, traumatic, or developmental in origin. They can present with massive otorrhagia or epistaxis from acute rupture or with decreased hearing and paresis of the fifth through eighth cranial nerves and, less frequently, of the ninth, 10th, and 12th cranial nerves caused by direct pressure. They can also produce pulsatile tinnitus, and sometimes they are discovered as a retrotympanic vascular mass during otological examination. The treatment of choice is carotid artery occlusion. Trapping of the aneurysm by detachable balloons eliminates immediately the risk of hemorrhage, offers the possibility of test occlusion of the internal carotid artery with the patient awake prior to permanent occlusion, and should also reduce the risk of thromboembolism. It should be preceded by a bypass procedure when preliminary evaluation indicates that the patient will not tolerate internal carotid artery occlusion.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"aneurysm of the ica petrous segment\", \"Symptoms\": [\"horizontal diplopia\", \"hemifacial numbness\"], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"balloon entrapment after EC-IC bypass\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [\"arteriography\"], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}], "completion": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"aneurysm of the ica petrous segment\", \"Symptoms\": [\"horizontal diplopia\", \"hemifacial numbness\"], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"left superficial temporal artery to middle cerebral artery bypass followed by balloon entrapment of the aneurysm\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [\"arteriography\"], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}\n\n"}

This technique has not been previously reported for treatment of dissection. Review of 34 published reports of symptomatic intimal dissection associated with non-penetrating trauma to the head and neck revealed that most did not have a direct injury to the carotid region and that development of symptoms was often delayed. Only 50% of these patients had onset of neurological symptoms within six hours of the episode of trauma, while 33% remained asymptomatic for more than one week before complications occurred. In 15 patients who were treated surgically, only nine (60%) achieved full recovery. Operative repair was considered unduly hazardous in our patient because of extension of the spiral dissection to the base of the skull.

The GVH was then treated with an anti-T lymphocyte monoclonal antibody (OKT3). The disease responded dramatically to this treatment but the GVH reappeared immediately at the end of OKT3 therapy and the patient died the 103th day after grafting. The autopsy revealed extensive lymphoid infiltrate by a monoclonal IgM K immunoblastic proliferation. After organ or bone marrow transplant, a wide spectrum of lymphoid lesions can be observed, ranging from follicular or diffuse polyclonal hyperplasia to monoclonal immunoblastic lymphoma.

We studied the natural history of esophageal stricture in 154 patients in whom bougienage was used as primary therapy. Dilatations were considered successful in terms of relief or major improvement of dysphagia in 84.5% of 103 patients followed 6 mo or longer (median, 26 mo). The risk of requiring esophageal dilatation after the initial episode was greatest in the first year of follow-up; thereafter, a smaller fraction of patients required dilatation each year. Forty-three percent of patients required no further dilatations, and a life-table analysis showed that 36% of patients would require no further dilatation during a projected 4-yr follow-up. The median frequency of subsequent dilatation was less than once a year. We were unable to identify any significant factors, such as initial severity of stricture, cause of stricture, presence of active esophagitis, or initial caliber of dilatation, that could predict the need for subsequent dilatation. Our results suggest that patients with benign strictures fall into two groups. In one group, the natural history was to improve or become asymptomatic after an initial series of dilatations, and only a small proportion eventually developed recurrent symptoms. The second group (46% of patients) required further dilatations to treat dysphagia during the first year of follow-up. Two-thirds of these patients needed regular dilatations in subsequent years. We conclude that bougienage is effective treatment for benign esophageal strictures, and should be utilized as primary therapy for most strictures.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"benign esophageal stricture\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"bougienage\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}], "completion": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"benign esophageal stricture\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"bougienage\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}\n\n"}

About 8 months ago, she suffered from ovarian cancer disseminated in pleura and peritoneum, and was treated successfully with CAP therapy only (Cis-platin, Adriamycin and Cyclophosphamide). Intracerebellar metastasis of ovarian cancer was suspected on CT scan, and CAP therapy was employed again. She was relieved from all symptoms a week after starting the therapy. Follow up CT scan showed complete remission of the lesion. She was well for about 3 months, but was admitted again because of consciousness disturbance and headache with multiple brain metastasis. PVB therapy (Cis-platin, Vinblastine and Pepleomycin) was employed this time, and complete remission was seen again. But regrowth of intraabdominal mass lesion appeared, and she died from multiple organ failure 5 months after PVB therapy.

We studied the efficacy and safety of catheter ablation in treating these patients. Six patients with the diagnosis of PJRT were treated at our institution with direct-current catheter ablation. The study cohort comprised three men and three women with a mean age of 33.8 +/- 4.5 years. The mean time from onset of symptoms to ablation was 129 +/- 44.7 months. All failed multiple drug therapy (mean number of drugs failed was 5.3 +/- 0.5). The left ventricular ejection fractions were calculated by echocardiography and were greater than 60% in all except two patients, whose ejection fractions were 25% and 32%. Symptom duration was significantly longer in those with depressed ejection fraction compared with normal patients (258 versus 64.5 months, p less than 0.01). Electrophysiological findings revealed evidence of an atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia involving retrograde decremental conduction over an accessory pathway localized to the posteroseptal area. Five patients received two direct-current shocks (250 +/- 16.7 J per shock) via paired electrodes from a catheter positioned just outside the coronary sinus os to a patch placed between the scapulae or on the anterior chest wall. One patient received a single direct-current shock of 300 J. The only complication was the development of complete atrioventricular block in one patient. This patient had previously undergone permanent pacemaker insertion for the sick sinus syndrome. The mean hospital stay after ablation was 2.2 days. Mean peak creatinine phosphokinase after ablation was 352 +/- 58.1 units/l and the MB fraction was 12 +/- 2%. Follow-up echocardiograms or gated nuclear studies showed improvement of ejection fraction in the two patients who presented with depressed ejection fractions. After a mean follow-up of 35.8 +/- 10.3 months, all patients remained free of tachycardia without antiarrhythmic drugs.

Apropos of 20 case reports.\nAbstract: Between 1966 and 1986, 27 tumors of the ampulla of Vater were operated on and 20 patients underwent potentially curative pancreatico-duodenal resection (PDR) (74% of resecability). The retrospective study of those 20 cases (13 men, 7 women, mean age: 59.9 +/- 9.8 years old) was done to evaluate the risks and the results of this type of wide resection. 15 patients (75%) had jaundice and gallbladder was palpable among 20 p. cent (4 cases) of the patients without cholecystectomy. Endoscopy was performed in 13 cases; endoscopic biopsies, done in 12 cases, were positive in 5 cases (45.4%), uncertain in three (25%) and falsely negative in four (33.3%). All the patients underwent Child's procedure. Histological analysis pointed out 15 adenocarcinomas and 5 malignant villous tumors; lymph node involvement was present in 11.1 p. cent; the staging following Martin's classification listed 6 stage 1, 3 stage II, 10 stage III and 1 stage IV. Operative mortality was of 5 p. cent; one patient died after an emergency procedure performed for massive bleeding but no death was observed in the group of patients treated out of emergency.

The rate of CR was 52%. Maintenance therapy was very simple and the only association with stanozolol during this period suggested to us that an androgen, at low dosages, might be responsible for the unusual long-term survival time (45 months with a 95% confidence limit from 30 to 86 months). On the basis of our first observation, high dosages of the androgen were used during the induction phase of treatment but failed to demonstrate any advantage when associated with a drug regimen, including cytosine arabinoside (ARA-C).

All patients were given a marrow graft from an HLA-identical sibling after receiving 1000-rad total body irradiation (TBI). One group of 43 patients was given cyclophosphamide (CY), 60 mg/kg on each of 2 days, 5 and 4 days before TBI. In a second group of 31 patients, additional chemotherapy was given before CY and TBI. In a third group of 19 patients, BCNU was given before CY and TBI. A fourth group of 7 patients received other chemotherapy regimens before TBI. Six patients died 3-17 days after marrow infusion without evidence of engraftment. Ninety-four patients were engrafted and only one patient rejected the graft. Thirteen patients are alive with a marrow graft, on no maintenance antileukemic therapy, and without recurrent leukemia 1-4 1/2 yr after transplantation. Three have chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Four patients are alive 1 1/2 - 3 1/2 yr after grafting but have had a relapse of their leukemia. Of 93 evaluable patients, 19 did not develop GVHD and 24 developed very mild GVHD. Fifty patients developed moderate to severe GVHD, and 40 of these were treated with antithymocyte globulin. Interstitial pneumonia occurred in 54 patients and was the primary cause of death in 34. Interstitial pneumonia often occurred in association with GVHD and the most common etiologic agent was cytomegalovirus. A total of 31 patients have had a relapse of leukemia. There was no definite correlation between relapse of leukemia and the presence or absence of GVHD. The relapse rate appeared to be relatively constant over the first 2 yr and was extremely low after that time. Neither survival nor leukemic relapse appeared to be influenced by the type of leukemia nor by the preparative chemotherapy regimen given before TBI. Patients in fair clinical condition at the time of transplantation showed significantly longer survival times than patients in poor condition (p = 0.001). This observation, coupled with the observation that some patients may be cured of their disease, indicates that marrow transplantation should now be undertaken earlier in the management of patients with acute leukemia who have an HLA-matched sibling marrow donor.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"acute leukemia\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"chemotherapy, total body irradiation and allogeneic marrow transplantation\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}], "completion": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"acute leukemia\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"chemotherapy, total body irradiation, and allogeneic marrow transplantation\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}\n\n"}

The first group of 10 patients were given marrow grafts at the time of leukemic relapse and the second group of six patients were given the grafts in the period of remission of their disease. For the first group (ALL/ANLL 2:8, age (median) 33, M/F 8:2), HLA-identical donor cells (25 x 10(7)/kg [median]) were infused after the patients were conditioned with NSC D 245382 (ACNU) or daunorubicin, cyclophosphamide (CY) and a single shot of 1000 rad of TBI. For the second group (ALL/ANLL 4:2, age (median) 20, M/F 5:1), HLA-identical donor cells (22 x 10(7)/kg [median]) were infused after the patients were conditioned with CY and fractionated (250 rad x 4) TBI. All the patients were isolated in a laminar air flow room (LAF) after gut and skin decontamination. Engraftment of donor cells was confirmed in 15 out of the 16 patients. Febrile periods in LAF and the days required for platelet transfusion were prolonged in the first group. All the patients in the first group died within 12-214 days after BMT because of interstitial pneumonitis (7 patients) or bacterial infection (3 patients). On the other hand, five out of six patients in the second group are alive 84-540 days after BMT. For the surviving patients, the complications of chronic graft versus host disease, viral infections, tuberculosis, hepatitis, hemorrhagic cystitis and recurrence of leukemia are now the problems. It can be stated that the patient's clinical condition at the time of BMT is one of the most essential factors for the success of BMT although the effects of other variables, such a change in the conditioning regimens of the supportive care, must also be carefully analyzed.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"acute leukemia\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"chemotherapy, total body irradiation and allogeneic marrow transplantation\", \"CureRate\": \"0.31\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [\"medical history,clinical imaging findings,serum antibody titer\"], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}], "completion": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"acute leukemia\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"chemotherapy, total body irradiation and allogeneic marrow transplantation\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}\n\n"}

Growth velocity (GV) was (mean +/- DS) 4 +/- 2.1 cm/year in boys and 1.6 +/- 1.65 in girls, with a bone age of 12.9 +/- 2.4 cm/year. T4 and DHA sulfate (DHAS) differed according to sex (boys: T4 = 70 +/- 4.7 ng/ml; DHAS = 655 +/- 139 ng/ml; girls: T4 = 102 +/- 16.6 ng/ml; DHAS = 118 +/- 35 ng/ml). IGF I, within normal limits, was correlated to bone age and pubertal stage. T4 was negatively correlated to testosterone and SDHA in boys. GV expressed as SD according to bone age was negatively correlated to PTH.hGH deficiency was evidenced in one case, and GV increased under hHG therapy.

The treatment was started with 4 cycles of chemotherapy with combination of adriamycin, vincristine, 5-fluorouracil and cyclophosphamide. This was followed by high-energy radiotherapy (45 Gy to the breast and lymphatic areas), with or without surgery. After radiotherapy, the response rate was 76%: 39/51 (complete response 39%: 20/51). Twenty-nine patients (57%) were treated conservatively (20 treated by radiotherapy alone and 9 treated by tumorectomy with axillary dissection followed by interstitial implantation). For 22 patients (43%), the mastectomy with axillary dissection was necessary. The three year overall survival rate and disease free survival rate were 88, and 86%.

Locations of the tumors were suprasellar in three cases, pineal in one case and basal ganglia in the other. Three of the 5 tumors were histologically verified as yolk sac tumors, embryonal carcinoma and HCG_producing germinoma. Two were histologically unverified HCG-producing tumors.

Two cases were treated only with cisplatin because ling fibrosis due to administration of bleomycin was intractable and harmful. Also the time when irradiation. It seemed better to administer chemotherapeutic agents prior to or during irradiation on account of the fact that, after radiotherapy, there is reduced blood flow in the tumor region. Also, CDDP acts as a radiosensitizer.

Its diagnosis has been considerably facilitated by echocardiography. We report a case of traumatic tricuspid insufficiency with extensive lesions of the tricuspid valve system, which was diagnosed after a 15-year period without functional signs. Echocardiography and Doppler ultrasounds provided very accurate information on the lesions. Optimal correction was obtained by conservative surgery.

Treatment by intraperitoneal administration of a group M penicillin.\nAbstract: From February 1980 to February 1983, 55 patients with chronic renal failure were put on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. Eighty-four episodes of peritonitis occurred., i.e one episode every 9.9 months of treatment. Since staphylococci accounted for 58% of the germs identified, intraperitoneal therapy with a penicillin M was instituted while dialysis was continued through chambers. Cure was obtained in 85.7% of all episodes, either with the penicillin M alone (57% of the cases) or after adjustment of the antibiotic therapy to bacteriological results (28.6% of the cases). Dialysis was discontinued in 10 patients (18%) on account of the peritonitis. The duration of hospital stay for peritonitis was 3.6 days per patient per year. These results were compared with those obtained by other groups. The advantages of penicillin M are its ease of administration, its narrow spectrum and high activity against the pathogens most commonly encountered, and its very low toxicity.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"peritonitis\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis\", \"CureRate\": \"0.857\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}], "completion": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"peritonitis\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"treatment by continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis.

Proliferation of the cells was triggered by medium conditioned by acute myelocytic leukemic cells exposed to 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol 13-acetate (TPA). The medium was designated as TPA-treated cell conditioned medium (TPACCM). The cycle of events in fetal bone marrow cell culture began with a sharp decrease in the total number of cells. At this juncture a predominance of primitive macrophage-like cells positive for macrophage markers was present in the culture. The process of multiplication began with rapid proliferation of promyelocytes. Simultaneous proliferation of granulocyte-macrophage (GM) colony forming cells (CFC) indicated that at least some of the promyelocytes might act like CFC. The absolute number of committed CFC then increased 5-11 fold, the number that approximated a total multiplication of FBM cells. The proliferation continued with the culture containing some blast cells and showing simultaneous differentiation of the cells into mature granulocytes and macrophages. The cells with macrophage markers persisted throughout the culture period. To determine more precise definition of the role of primitive macrophages and promyelocytes in FBM cell multiplication, experiments with purified fractions of these cells have to be done. TPACCM purification and isolation of active substances is also suggested. These investigations might result in obtaining a pool of BM cells in vitro suitable for BM transplantation.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol 13-acetate (TPA)\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

The only problem concerns the type of pitressin to be used. In the past, pitressin snuff and various other intranasal instillations have been used, but these either have not been very effective, or have resulted in unpleasant side effects such as rhinitis. Until recently, the only effective form of the drug available in Australia has been pitressin tannate in oil. This often has to be given as a daily injection, which, like all intramuscular injections, is painful and, being in an oily base, is particularly likely to result in abscess formation.

Concentrations of FU varied widely in many patients. Concentration of drug X time of infusion (C X t values) were calculated. Patients showing a partial response or stabilization of disease had significantly higher C X t values than non-responders. Methyl CCNU did not affect the C X t values of FU.

Cyst volume was quantified both geometrically and isotopically with 99Tc, values differing by 7%. Dosimetry was determined by applying the formula developed by Loevinger et al., and 20,000 rads were administered throughout to the cystic wall. All 17 patients, except for 4 children, had previously received surgery, shunts or radiotherapy, alone or combined. In 4 cases, 90Y injection was the only treatment, while in 6, the cyst was evacuated at 10 days following radiocolloid injection. Skull and spinal column gamma chamber studies were carried out on all patients at 24, 48, and 72 hours post injection, but no isotope leakage could be detected. The patients returned to normal activities except one with multiple cysts who died. There were no changes in the endocrinologic profile. In one case, a decrease in visual acuity 18 months after treatment, improved following corticoid administration.

VP-16-213 was given on relapse. Response rate and survival were analyzed according to extent of tumor, presence of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone production (SIADH), and, in 38 patients, size of intrathoracic tumor as measured by computerized tomographic (CT) scanning. The median survival of the entire group was 34.6 weeks. In patients with limited disease the median survival was 46 weeks compared to 29 weeks for those with extensive disease. This difference in survival between patients with limited and extensive disease was most marked in those showing a partial response (median survival, 45.9 and 28 weeks, respectively). Patients with ectopic antidiuretic hormone production had a poor prognosis even if they had achieved a complete response. Only one partial response to VP-16-213 occurred. There was a strong correlation between initial intrathoracic tumor size as assessed by total cross-sectional area on CT scan and response and survival. When the total area exceeded 30 cm2 there were no complete responders, but there were complete responses in eight of 21 patients when the area was less than 30 cm2. The relationship between intrathoracic tumor size and response rate was present when analyzed according to disease extent, age, sex, and performance status. A clear relationship between total tumor area and survival was also found. When SCCB is treated with chemotherapy alone, the prognosis is better for those patients who present with limited disease, without SIADH, and with small intrathoracic tumor. In this group it is possible that further intensification of therapy may result in prolonged survival.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"small cell carcinoma of the bronchus\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"a combination of cyclophosphamide, methotrexate with calcium leucovorin rescue, and lomustine (CCNU).\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

The hearing gain from adenoidectomy alone was similar to that resulting from insertion of a grommet alone, but the children having adenoidectomy required fewer reinsertions to maintain adequate subjective hearing thresholds in the treated ear (26% versus 54%). Tonsillectomy conferred no additional benefit.

Twenty-two were infected and 21 were refractory to random platelet transfusions at the time of admission. All were given marrow grafts from HLA-identical siblings. Forty-five were conditioned for grafting by cyclophosphamide (CY), 50 mg/kg on each of 4 successive days, and four by 1000 rad total body irradiation. All were given intermittent methotrexate therapy within the first 100 days of grafting to modify graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Three patients died from infection too early to evaluate (days 1-8). Forty-six had marrow engraftment. Of these, 20 are surviving with good peripheral blood counts between 186 and 999 days, and 18 have returned to normal activities. Chronic GCHD is a problem in five. Twelve patients died of infection following rejection of the marrow graft. Twelve patients died with bacterial or fungal infections or interstitial pneumonia and active GVHD or soon following resolution of GVHD. Two patients died with marrow engraftment and no GVHD, one with an interstitial, and the other with a bacterial pneumonia. Thirty-six patients who had received random donor blood transfusions were randomly assigned to receive either CY or procarbazine-antithymocyte globulin-CY as conditioning regimens to test whether the incidence of graft rejection could be decreased. There was no difference in the incidence of graft rejection between the two regimens.

The goals of the combined procedure were to increase correction of the curve and decrease the rate of pseudarthrosis. Preoperatively, the major curves measured an average of 83 degrees, and on the best side-bend they averaged 59 degrees, a 29 per cent degree of flexibility. At the time of discharge from the hospital the curves had improved to an average of 44 degrees, a correction of the preoperative curve of 39 degrees or 47 per cent. At an average length of follow-up of forty-nine months, the major curves measured an average of 50 degrees, a 41 per cent correction compared with the initial curves. Twenty-three of the major curves were better than when they were measured on the preoperative radiograph of the best side-bend, by an average of 15 degrees, but eight curves were either the same or worse. No patient had pseudarthrosis or permanent neurological injury. It is our conclusion that a two-stage anterior and posterior fusion is of value for the treatment of the adult who has a rigid curve that requires maximum correction to allow the head, shoulders, and torso to be centered over the pelvis.

We studied the progression of the kyphosis and evaluated the function and fate of the bone grafts that were used. At eight years, the results with respect to the progression of the kyphosis were classified as excellent or good in forty-eight patients (59 per cent), all of whom had had minimum destruction of the vertebral bodies; limited surgical excision of bone, resulting in a small post-debridement defect that needed only a short graft; marked intraoperative correction of the deformity; and involvement of lower lumbar segments. Fifteen patients (19 per cent) had a fair result and eighteen (22 per cent), a poor result. An increase in the deformity was common in patients who had extensive involvement of the vertebral bodies that had resulted in a large post-debridement defect necessitating a graft spanning more than two disc spaces. Lesions of the thoracic vertebrae were associated with many of the poor results, and patients who had a marked kyphosis before treatment also did not do well. A stable graft that provided structural support was observed in only thirty-three patients (41 per cent), and failure of the graft due to slippage, fracture, absorption, or subsidence was seen in forty-eight patients (59 per cent). The length of the graft also played a role: the graft failed most often in patients in whom it spanned more than two disc spaces. We concluded that it is unwise to rely solely on the graft to prevent vertebral collapse in patients in whom the length of the graft exceeds two disc spaces. These patients may benefit from additional measures, such as an extended period of non-weight-bearing, posterior arthrodesis after six to twelve weeks, and prolonged use of a brace until complete consolidation is evident.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"tuberculosis of the spine\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"anterior arthrodesis\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

Successful results were noted in 792 ureteric units; in 10 cases of post-operative stenosis and 17 cases of recurrent VUR a second AUVB was performed. The following causes of operative failure were found: obstruction of the submucosal ureter after tailoring (5 cases), stricture of the new ureteric orifice (3), necrosis of the terminal part of the ureter (2), submucosal ureter too short or too wide (12) and fibrosis of the detrusor muscle over the submucosal ureter (5); a success rate of 84% was noted after the second procedure.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"primary vesicoureteric reflux\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"antireflux ureterocystostomy\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

One hundred and eleven cases completed the whole course of study, and only one failed to be followed up. The results of the follow-up for 12 mon showed that the remission rate was 41.4% (46/111) and relapse rate was 58.6% (65/111). The present study indicated that the remission or relapse was related with serum levels of T3 before treatment, shrank goiter and disappearance of goiter bruit during the treatment as well as thyroid suppression rate, but not related to sex, age, period of illness before therapy or severity of the disease. It is suggested that a 6-mon antithyroid drug therapy instead of traditional long term therapy may be suitable for those patients who are with a reduced goiter and disappeared goiter bruit during the antithyroid therapy, and suppressible thyroid up-take by T3 and whose serum levels of T3 before treatment are not very high.

Two vertebral bodies were affected in 82 patients, one in 23 cases, more than 4 in 70 patients. Sixty-one patients had neural involvement at the time of admission, 42 of them an incomplete or complete paraplegia. All patients were treated by triple-drug chemotherapy. Chemotherapy and bed rest alone was sufficient for 76 patients. Surgical intervention was indicated in 132 cases. Debridement was carried out in 33 cases, debridement and spinal fusion was performed in 18 cases, anterolateral decompression of the spinal cord alone was employed in 15 cases, and together with spinal fusion recommended in 15 cases. Minor surgical procedures were made necessary in 8 cases. The indications for surgery were: (1) unfavorable response to conservative treatment during 3 months, (2) Pott's paraplegia showing no signs of recovery by conservative treatment, (3) Pott's paraplegia developing during conservative treatment (4) cases with unstable spinal lesions, and (5) cases with paravertebral abscesses and sinuses. Complete or good recovery occurred in 61 out of 76 conservatively treated patients. Forty-two out of 61 patients with neural involvement made a complete or a good recovery, 31 being patients with paraplegia. No improvement was noted in 16 cases with neural involvement, and 2 had progression of the neurological signs. A complete recovery was noted in 101 out of 132 operatively treated patients, a good recovery in 21, and no improvement in 9 patients with paraplegia. One patient died; 141 patients returned to their former work, 30 of whom were recovered paraplegics. Fifteen had retired because of advanced age. Modern treatment begins with triple-drug chemotherapy and bed rest for 3 months. If the response is unsatisfactory, debridement or debridement with spinal fusion is carried out as soon as possible. Anterolateral decompression is applied in cases with paraplegia.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"spinal tuberculosis\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"antituberculous chemotherapy and radical operation\", \"CureRate\": \"0.48\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

She had no history of trauma to the calf, and family history was negative for muscle disease. Physical examination showed an enlarged left calf muscle with pain which was evoked by stretching of the Achilles tendon. There was no muscle weakness or neurological abnormality. Laboratory tests were all within normal limits, including erythrocyte sedimentation rate and serum enzymes such as creatine kinase and aldolase. The CT scan revealed an isolated round-shaped low density area in the left calf muscle, which showed up as a markedly high signal intensity on T2 weighted images of MRI. The lesion was confirmed to be the lateral head of the gastrocnemius muscle. The specimen obtained from the affected muscle demonstrated degenerative and inflammatory changes together with excess fibrosis. There was no sarcoid lesion or malignancy. From the above results, the present case was thought to have isolated focal myositis. Prednisolone 80 mg (40 mg, twice, at 4-day intervals) was given to the left femoral artery without any trouble. Thereafter the patient became free from pain and difficulty in walking, and the lesion demonstrated by CT scan disappeared in 15 days. However, the high signal intensity on T2 weighted images faintly remained until the 54th day after the treatment.

A total of 25 patients received combined treatment with bacillus Calmette-Guerin and interleukin-2 at weekly instillations for 6 consecutive weeks and then monthly for 1 year. T antigen expression in all patients was studied before treatment. Of the patients 16 had positive T antigen expression in the tumors: 13 (81%) remained free of tumor for an average of 28 months, 3 had a noninvasive recurrence each at 8 to 27 months (mean 18 months) and all responded well to a repeated treatment cycle. Nine patients were negative for T antigen: 1 (11%) remained free of tumor for 11 months, while 8 had recurrence within 12 months. Of the latter 8 patients 2 had noninvasive recurrence each at 4 to 5 months but they responded to a repeated treatment cycle and remained free of tumor for 4 to 22 months (mean 13 months), 4 had subsequent repeated recurrences at 12 to 41 months (mean 22 months) and 2 had progression to deep invasion resulting in cystectomy at 11 to 12 months. Thus, the disease-free rate (continuous complete response) in patients with tumors positive for T antigen was 81%, while that in patients with tumors negative for T antigen was 11% (p less than 0.005, chi-square test). The over-all response rate in patients with positive and negative tumors to bacillus Calmette-Guerin and interleukin-2 treatment was 100 and 33%, respectively, and that for the total patients was 76%.

Importance of haemodynamic parameters before and after dilatation.\nAbstract: Early and late prognosis after percutaneous balloon aortic valvuloplasty (PBAV) was assessed in 38 consecutive elderly patients (mean age, 78.5 +/- 6.1 years). Significant valve opening was achieved in 35 patients. The hospital mortality was 8% (three patients); two other patients died within the first month and three underwent aortic valve replacement. At 2 years follow-up, there were 10 additional deaths (seven cardiac deaths) and five patients had symptom recurrence managed by aortic valve replacement (3) or repeat PBAV (2). Overall, six patients underwent surgery without untoward events and six had repeat PBAV. Only two out of six patients with repeat PBAV had sustained improvement; one was referred to surgery and the remaining three died soon after the second PBAV. One- and 2-year survival were respectively 72 and 62% and percentage of survivors with persistent improvement 68 and 41%. Although aortic valve area after PBAV was associated with outcome, predictors of poor long-term prognosis were primarily related to the pre-operative haemodynamic status.

The patient was successfully treated with a left superficial temporal artery to middle cerebral artery bypass followed by balloon entrapment of the aneurysm. There have been at least 40 previously reported cases of aneurysms of the petrous portion of the carotid artery. These aneurysms can be mycotic, traumatic, or developmental in origin. They can present with massive otorrhagia or epistaxis from acute rupture or with decreased hearing and paresis of the fifth through eighth cranial nerves and, less frequently, of the ninth, 10th, and 12th cranial nerves caused by direct pressure. They can also produce pulsatile tinnitus, and sometimes they are discovered as a retrotympanic vascular mass during otological examination. The treatment of choice is carotid artery occlusion. Trapping of the aneurysm by detachable balloons eliminates immediately the risk of hemorrhage, offers the possibility of test occlusion of the internal carotid artery with the patient awake prior to permanent occlusion, and should also reduce the risk of thromboembolism. It should be preceded by a bypass procedure when preliminary evaluation indicates that the patient will not tolerate internal carotid artery occlusion.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"aneurysm of the ica petrous segment\", \"Symptoms\": [\"horizontal diplopia\", \"hemifacial numbness\"], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"balloon entrapment after EC-IC bypass\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [\"arteriography\"], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

This technique has not been previously reported for treatment of dissection. Review of 34 published reports of symptomatic intimal dissection associated with non-penetrating trauma to the head and neck revealed that most did not have a direct injury to the carotid region and that development of symptoms was often delayed. Only 50% of these patients had onset of neurological symptoms within six hours of the episode of trauma, while 33% remained asymptomatic for more than one week before complications occurred. In 15 patients who were treated surgically, only nine (60%) achieved full recovery. Operative repair was considered unduly hazardous in our patient because of extension of the spiral dissection to the base of the skull.

In spite of the use of syngeneic bone marrow, failure of engraftment occurred on two occasions. In vitro studies demonstrated that natural killer (NK) cells from the recipient markedly inhibited the growth of donor bone marrow granulocyte progenitor cells.

Apropos of a case treated by OKT3 monoclonal antibodies for an acute graft versus host reaction.\nAbstract: The incidence of malignant lymphoma after bone marrow transplant seems very low. A 31 years old patient was treated with allogeneic bone marrow transplantation for chronic myeloid leukemia; she develops 12 days after grafting a severe graft-versus-host disease (GVH) refractory to treatment with steroids and Cyclosporin A. The GVH was then treated with an anti-T lymphocyte monoclonal antibody (OKT3). The disease responded dramatically to this treatment but the GVH reappeared immediately at the end of OKT3 therapy and the patient died the 103th day after grafting. The autopsy revealed extensive lymphoid infiltrate by a monoclonal IgM K immunoblastic proliferation. After organ or bone marrow transplant, a wide spectrum of lymphoid lesions can be observed, ranging from follicular or diffuse polyclonal hyperplasia to monoclonal immunoblastic lymphoma. The criteria for monoclonality are discussed.

We studied the natural history of esophageal stricture in 154 patients in whom bougienage was used as primary therapy. Dilatations were considered successful in terms of relief or major improvement of dysphagia in 84.5% of 103 patients followed 6 mo or longer (median, 26 mo). The risk of requiring esophageal dilatation after the initial episode was greatest in the first year of follow-up; thereafter, a smaller fraction of patients required dilatation each year. Forty-three percent of patients required no further dilatations, and a life-table analysis showed that 36% of patients would require no further dilatation during a projected 4-yr follow-up. The median frequency of subsequent dilatation was less than once a year. We were unable to identify any significant factors, such as initial severity of stricture, cause of stricture, presence of active esophagitis, or initial caliber of dilatation, that could predict the need for subsequent dilatation. Our results suggest that patients with benign strictures fall into two groups. In one group, the natural history was to improve or become asymptomatic after an initial series of dilatations, and only a small proportion eventually developed recurrent symptoms. The second group (46% of patients) required further dilatations to treat dysphagia during the first year of follow-up. Two-thirds of these patients needed regular dilatations in subsequent years.

Besides the clinical data related to prostatism, prostatic volume was studied in 4 of the 5 patients by means of transrectal ultrasonography. All 5 patients showed a marked decrease of prostatic volume, which averaged 31.4% (range 19-55%) after 2-3 months. This correlated well with a relief of urinary obstruction.

We studied the efficacy and safety of catheter ablation in treating these patients. Six patients with the diagnosis of PJRT were treated at our institution with direct-current catheter ablation. The study cohort comprised three men and three women with a mean age of 33.8 +/- 4.5 years. The mean time from onset of symptoms to ablation was 129 +/- 44.7 months. All failed multiple drug therapy (mean number of drugs failed was 5.3 +/- 0.5). The left ventricular ejection fractions were calculated by echocardiography and were greater than 60% in all except two patients, whose ejection fractions were 25% and 32%. Symptom duration was significantly longer in those with depressed ejection fraction compared with normal patients (258 versus 64.5 months, p less than 0.01). Electrophysiological findings revealed evidence of an atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia involving retrograde decremental conduction over an accessory pathway localized to the posteroseptal area. Five patients received two direct-current shocks (250 +/- 16.7 J per shock) via paired electrodes from a catheter positioned just outside the coronary sinus os to a patch placed between the scapulae or on the anterior chest wall. One patient received a single direct-current shock of 300 J. The only complication was the development of complete atrioventricular block in one patient. This patient had previously undergone permanent pacemaker insertion for the sick sinus syndrome. The mean hospital stay after ablation was 2.2 days. Mean peak creatinine phosphokinase after ablation was 352 +/- 58.1 units/l and the MB fraction was 12 +/- 2%. Follow-up echocardiograms or gated nuclear studies showed improvement of ejection fraction in the two patients who presented with depressed ejection fractions. After a mean follow-up of 35.8 +/- 10.3 months, all patients remained free of tachycardia without antiarrhythmic drugs. We conclude that catheter ablation by using direct current energy appears to be an effective treatment in patients with PJRT.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"junctional reciprocating tachycardia\", \"Symptoms\": [\"narrow-complex tachycardia\"], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"catheter ablation\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

Three patients underwent transcatheter oily chemoembolization (TOCE) (7 courses), and one received intraarterial iodized oil with chemotherapeutic drug after surgical intraarterial catheter placement (1 course).

All patients were treated by CAVHD using Hospal AN69S 0.43 m2 filters and Fresenius 1.5% peritoneal dialysis fluid at dialysate flow rates (Qd) of 1 and 2 l/h. Patients received cefuroxime 500 mg (n = 11) or 750 mg (n = 1), or ceftazidime 500 mg (n = 9) i.v. 12-hourly and all studies were done at steady-state. For cefuroxime, volume of distribution (Vdarea) was 22.8 +/- 3.5 l, terminal elimination half-life (t1/2) 12.6 +/- 2.2 h and total body clearance (TBC) 22.3 +/- 3.0 ml/min (mean +/- SEM). Mean sieving coefficient (SC) was 0.90 +/- 0.12 and filter clearances at Qd 1 and 2 l/h were 14.0 +/- 2.3 and 16.2 +/- 3.4 ml/min respectively.

Apropos of 20 case reports.\nAbstract: Between 1966 and 1986, 27 tumors of the ampulla of Vater were operated on and 20 patients underwent potentially curative pancreatico-duodenal resection (PDR) (74% of resecability). The retrospective study of those 20 cases (13 men, 7 women, mean age: 59.9 +/- 9.8 years old) was done to evaluate the risks and the results of this type of wide resection. 15 patients (75%) had jaundice and gallbladder was palpable among 20 p. cent (4 cases) of the patients without cholecystectomy. Endoscopy was performed in 13 cases; endoscopic biopsies, done in 12 cases, were positive in 5 cases (45.4%), uncertain in three (25%) and falsely negative in four (33.3%). All the patients underwent Child's procedure. Histological analysis pointed out 15 adenocarcinomas and 5 malignant villous tumors; lymph node involvement was present in 11.1 p. cent; the staging following Martin's classification listed 6 stage 1, 3 stage II, 10 stage III and 1 stage IV. Operative mortality was of 5 p. cent; one patient died after an emergency procedure performed for massive bleeding but no death was observed in the group of patients treated out of emergency.

The rate of CR was 52%. Maintenance therapy was very simple and the only association with stanozolol during this period suggested to us that an androgen, at low dosages, might be responsible for the unusual long-term survival time (45 months with a 95% confidence limit from 30 to 86 months). On the basis of our first observation, high dosages of the androgen were used during the induction phase of treatment but failed to demonstrate any advantage when associated with a drug regimen, including cytosine arabinoside (ARA-C).

No variations of such activity observed in patients without therapeutic response or with minor response could be considered as a marker of primary or acquired resistance to chemotherapy.

All patients were given a marrow graft from an HLA-identical sibling after receiving 1000-rad total body irradiation (TBI). One group of 43 patients was given cyclophosphamide (CY), 60 mg/kg on each of 2 days, 5 and 4 days before TBI. In a second group of 31 patients, additional chemotherapy was given before CY and TBI. In a third group of 19 patients, BCNU was given before CY and TBI. A fourth group of 7 patients received other chemotherapy regimens before TBI. Six patients died 3-17 days after marrow infusion without evidence of engraftment. Ninety-four patients were engrafted and only one patient rejected the graft. Thirteen patients are alive with a marrow graft, on no maintenance antileukemic therapy, and without recurrent leukemia 1-4 1/2 yr after transplantation. Three have chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Four patients are alive 1 1/2 - 3 1/2 yr after grafting but have had a relapse of their leukemia. Of 93 evaluable patients, 19 did not develop GVHD and 24 developed very mild GVHD. Fifty patients developed moderate to severe GVHD, and 40 of these were treated with antithymocyte globulin. Interstitial pneumonia occurred in 54 patients and was the primary cause of death in 34. Interstitial pneumonia often occurred in association with GVHD and the most common etiologic agent was cytomegalovirus. A total of 31 patients have had a relapse of leukemia. There was no definite correlation between relapse of leukemia and the presence or absence of GVHD. The relapse rate appeared to be relatively constant over the first 2 yr and was extremely low after that time. Neither survival nor leukemic relapse appeared to be influenced by the type of leukemia nor by the preparative chemotherapy regimen given before TBI. Patients in fair clinical condition at the time of transplantation showed significantly longer survival times than patients in poor condition (p = 0.001). This observation, coupled with the observation that some patients may be cured of their disease, indicates that marrow transplantation should now be undertaken earlier in the management of patients with acute leukemia who have an HLA-matched sibling marrow donor.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"acute leukemia\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"chemotherapy, total body irradiation and allogeneic marrow transplantation\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

The first group of 10 patients were given marrow grafts at the time of leukemic relapse and the second group of six patients were given the grafts in the period of remission of their disease. For the first group (ALL/ANLL 2:8, age (median) 33, M/F 8:2), HLA-identical donor cells (25 x 10(7)/kg [median]) were infused after the patients were conditioned with NSC D 245382 (ACNU) or daunorubicin, cyclophosphamide (CY) and a single shot of 1000 rad of TBI. For the second group (ALL/ANLL 4:2, age (median) 20, M/F 5:1), HLA-identical donor cells (22 x 10(7)/kg [median]) were infused after the patients were conditioned with CY and fractionated (250 rad x 4) TBI. All the patients were isolated in a laminar air flow room (LAF) after gut and skin decontamination. Engraftment of donor cells was confirmed in 15 out of the 16 patients. Febrile periods in LAF and the days required for platelet transfusion were prolonged in the first group. All the patients in the first group died within 12-214 days after BMT because of interstitial pneumonitis (7 patients) or bacterial infection (3 patients). On the other hand, five out of six patients in the second group are alive 84-540 days after BMT. For the surviving patients, the complications of chronic graft versus host disease, viral infections, tuberculosis, hepatitis, hemorrhagic cystitis and recurrence of leukemia are now the problems. It can be stated that the patient's clinical condition at the time of BMT is one of the most essential factors for the success of BMT although the effects of other variables, such a change in the conditioning regimens of the supportive care, must also be carefully analyzed.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"acute leukemia\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"chemotherapy, total body irradiation and allogeneic marrow transplantation\", \"CureRate\": \"0.31\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [\"medical history,clinical imaging findings,serum antibody titer\"], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

Long-term outcome.\nAbstract: The authors have operated on 284 simple fractures, complicated by 12 post-operative infections (4.2 per cent) and 43 compound fractures, complicated by four infections (9.3 per cent). All the fractures were treated by plating. Thirteen of the infected cases have received long-term follow-up - ten after simple fractures and three after compound fractures. Nine out of the ten cases following simple fractures have healed, eight retaining the plate until consolidation and two being considered as infected non-unions. One of these two healed secondarily after fresh fixation and the other is still draining after a second operation, but has united. Two out of the four cases following compound fractures have already healed. The two others were considered as infected non-union and healed after fresh fixation. It is concluded that infection after fracture of the femoral shaft is a serious complication, but healing can be obtained in almost all cases.

Eighty-four episodes of peritonitis occurred., i.e one episode every 9.9 months of treatment. Since staphylococci accounted for 58% of the germs identified, intraperitoneal therapy with a penicillin M was instituted while dialysis was continued through chambers. Cure was obtained in 85.7% of all episodes, either with the penicillin M alone (57% of the cases) or after adjustment of the antibiotic therapy to bacteriological results (28.6% of the cases). Dialysis was discontinued in 10 patients (18%) on account of the peritonitis. The duration of hospital stay for peritonitis was 3.6 days per patient per year. These results were compared with those obtained by other groups. The advantages of penicillin M are its ease of administration, its narrow spectrum and high activity against the pathogens most commonly encountered, and its very low toxicity.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"peritonitis\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis\", \"CureRate\": \"0.857\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

Under conditions of a conventional diabetes diet (including 5-6 meals per day and a strictly planned meal intake) as well as under a \"less restricted diabetes diet\" (e.g., free choice of number, timing, and amount of carbohydrate intake) near normoglycemia could be achieved. Mean daily blood glucose levels did not change significantly when the patients' nutrition was alternated between both diets. During the \"less restricted diabetes diet,\" the patients opted for a rather high fat intake (51 +/- 5% fat, 34 +/- 5% carbohydrate, and 15 +/- 2% protein). Despite this unintended dietary behavior, serum lipids and body weight remained normal after an observation period of 4-6 mo. It is concluded that during permanent near normoglycemia achieved by CSII a partial liberalization of the diabetes diet does not introduce any short-term or long-term metabolic risk factors for cardiovascular diseases.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"type i diabetes\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

Mean plasma glucose levels were near-normal during the 24 h and, in particular, constant throughout the night. In a subset of six patients overnight plasma free insulin concentrations were also constant during CSII. The majority of profiles (88%) showed a glucose nadir from 2.0 to 5.9 mmol/L (most frequently at 0600 h) and had an 0800 h value from 2.0 to 6.9 mmol/L (92%). A large proportion (46%) of profiles showed a zero or negative nadir-0800 h glycemic increase. In 22 patients with three or more profiles recorded at the same basal insulin infusion rate, only one of 103 profiles had a fasting glycemic increase greater than an arbitrary value of 5.0 mmol/L (5.3), although many patients exhibited small dawn glycemic increases (e.g., 14 of 22 had a mean increase of from 0 to 2 mmol/L). In 12 subjects a 15% reduction in basal insulin infusion rate increased the mean +/- SEM dawn glycemic increase from 0.58 +/- 0.25 mmol/L to 2.7 +/- 0.76 mmol/L (P less than 0.025) as well as significantly increasing the nocturnal nadir and 0800 h plasma glucose concentrations. Thus, a marked dawn phenomenon is rare when a single but adequate basal infusion rate is used for CSII, and this questions the need in the majority of patients for preprogrammable pumps with nocturnal infusion rate changes.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"diabetes\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

They are aged from 45 to 79 years old, the average 56, and aspirated 1 to 24 days after the onset, two third of them being within 1 week. The whole procedure was done in the CT room under direct CT guidance and by one trial. In putaminal type hemorrhage, the removed hematoma volumes ranged from 9 to 48 ml, average being 23.7 ml, in thalamic type from 5 to 29 ml, average being 15.5 ml. The average rate of removal was 81.1% in 30 cases within 1 week. In most cases, preoperative consciousness was not severely disturbed, in putaminal type, 19 were alert or confused, 4 somnolent, 5 stuperous and in thalamic type, 6, 6, 3 respectively and 2 were semicomatous, one of them had herniation sign. In putaminal type all but 2 cases recovered to alert or confused state, the first one had postoperative bleeding and the other was already apallic preoperatively. In thalamic type, we lost 3 cases, 2 by gastrointestinal bleeding and 1 DIC, by rehemorrhage 2 months after the operation. All but one who was semicomatous preoperatively recovered to alertness. In motor function, some cases of the putaminal bleeding with intact internal capsule remained hemiplegic. On the other hand, most of the cases with partial destruction of the internal capsule on CT recovered well in both types of hematoma.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"hypertensive intracerebral hematoma\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"CT guided stereotactic aspiration\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

Considering the young age of the patient an operation of surgical denervation of the right carotid sinus was decided upon. This simple and riskless treatment allowed the case to be solved without resorting to permanent pacemaker implantation.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"carotid sinus syndrome\", \"Symptoms\": [\"syncopal attacks\", \"episodes of dizziness\"], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"denervation of right carotid sinus\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

We successfully treated such a case by the detachable balloon method. The patient, a 2-year-and-9-month-old female who has no history of trauma had a pulsating mass at her right retroauricular region six months after birth. On admission to our clinic she was neurologically free except the pulsating mass (2 X 3 cm) with bruit and thrill. Selective right external carotid angiography revealed a high-flow simple AVF from internal maxillary artery to jugular vein. The normal blood flow of both the external and internal carotid system was decreased. Under local anesthesia, non-detachable balloon catheter was inserted to the internal maxillary artery by the transfemoral approach and inflated at the proximal side of the orifice of AVF until the vascular murmur in the neck disappeared. The balloon catheter was then exchanged with a detachable balloon catheter (Debrun, No. 9) which was inflated by silicone (0.4 ml), and was detached successfully. Follow-up angiography 1 year after the treatment revealed no recurrence of the fistula and almost branches of external carotid artery such as middle meningeal artery, occipital artery, superficial temporal artery and facial artery were clearly seen.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"spontaneous arteriovenous fistula of the external carotid artery\", \"Symptoms\": [\"pulsating mass at right retroauricular region\", \"bruit\", \"thrill\"], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"detachable balloon method\", \"CureRate\": \"1.0\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [\"selective right external carotid angiography\"], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

Annual incidence of end stage renal failure (ESRF) treated by dialysis increased of 25% when two consecutive periods of five years each were compared: A (1976-1980) 46 per 10(6) inhabitants, B (1981-1985) 62 per 10(6) inhabitants. In 1986, the progression was confirmed: 96 per 10(6). At the time of the beginning of dialysis treatment, mean age (+/- SD) was not different between two periods: 53 +/- 17 yrs (A) vs 51 +/- 17 yrs (B) but it increased in 1986: 61 +/- 14 yrs. Sex ratio (M/F) progressed from 1 (A) to 1.75 (B). The study of causes of ESRF showed a net increase of secondary renal diseases (diabetes, amyloidosis), interstitial nephropathies due to obstructive uropathy (lithiasis) and drugs. For the period B, 91% of primary glomerulonephritis reaching ESRF had had renal biopsy. Idiopathic IgA nephropathy was the first cause of ESRF (13.7%, 0.85 pts/100,000) before diabetes (12%, 0.75/100,000), Polycystic disease (11.3%, 0.70/100,000), reflux nephropathy (9.6%, 0.60/100,000), focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis (8.8%, 055/100,000). Prevalence of ESRF for primary glomerulonephritis was calculated to 20.6% and according to the histological type to 28.3% for idiopathic IgA nephropathy, 34.8% for local and segmental glomerulosclerosis, 40% for idiopathic crescentic glomerulonephritis and only 6.6% for membraneous nephropathy.

A 59-year-old man was admitted because of sudden deep coma and tetraparesis. Neurological examination on admission showed miotic pupils with absent light reaction, no oculocephalic reflex, no corneal reflex and tetraparesis. Glasgow scale was evaluated to be E-1 V-1, and M-3 with total of 5 points. Computed tomography confirmed a large hematoma in the cerebellum with ventricular rupture. Immediately, a suboccipital craniectomy was performed and the hematoma was evacuated. His neurological condition was improved gradually within a month after the operation. He responded to verbal orders and moved all his limbs against gravity. His respiration, however, was irregular with a pattern of so-called \"cluster breathing\" followed by prolonged apnea, that was more pronounced in night. He was suffered from hypoxic hypercapnea and recurrent pneumonia. Therefore, authors decided to employ diaphragm pacing for management of central alveolar hypoventilation. A diaphragm pacemaker (radiofrequency induction) was implanted. A cuff electrode was put around the right phrenic nerve in the right thorax, and the receiver installed subcutaneously in the right anterior chest. Postoperative respiratory study showed ventilation on pacing with satisfactory blood gas and he became able to move around using a wheel chair. In 1966 Glenn demonstrated a new technique to move the diaphragm paced by a receiver through the phrenic nerve, triggered by radio wave from external device.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"central alveolar hypoventilation\", \"Symptoms\": [\"sudden deep coma\", \"tetraparesis\"], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"diaphragm pacing\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [\"computed tomography (CT)\"], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

Measurements were made before and at intervals during treatment, the tendinous xanthomas being measured by an echographic procedure to give data on antero-posterior and lateral diameters, thus enabling an Achilles tendon index to be defined. The results confirm the hypolipidaemic activity of bezafibrate, changes in the levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, lipids and lipoproteins (LDL, VLDL and HDL) being similar in direction and magnitude to those reported previously. A significant regression in the size of the Achilles tendon xanthomas was observed in 11 of the 13 patients, and the regression in the Achilles tendon index correlated significantly with a favourable change in the ratio HDL/LDL + VLDL.

The average mean percentage change ranged from -58 to +133% compared with untreated samples. The apolipoprotein method selected was validated by comparing their concentrations with their corresponding lipoprotein lipid or protein in normal controls and Type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) diabetic patients.

However, the only alteration in VLDL composition was a small decrease in the relative proportion of phospholipid. Apolipoprotein-B and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentrations were also raised in type II patients at diagnosis. Plasma concentrations of high density lipoprotein (HDL) nonesterified and esterified cholesterol, phospholipid, and apo-AI were lower in type II patients at diagnosis. This was largely accounted for by reduced concentrations of these components in the HDL2 subfraction, which retained a normal composition. Type II patients treated by diet alone and diet + glibenclamide exhibited similar abnormalities of plasma lipoprotein concentrations, which are associated with premature coronary disease, to the type II patients at diagnosis. However, in type II patients treated with insulin, plasma lipoprotein concentrations and composition were normal, except LDL cholesterol, which was lower than normal in insulin-treated patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"non-insulin-dependent diabetes\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"diet, sulphonylurea, and insulin\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

All cases recovered reversibly from dementia within a few weeks after stoppage of taking anticholinergic drug. And any of our cases had no possibility in the cause of chronic dementia other than the side effect of anticholinergic drug. Detailed neuropsychological examinations (WAIS, WMSR, and so on) were conducted in all cases, SPECT was in two cases, and PET was in one case, before and after stoppage of the anticholinergic drug. And in all cases, brain MRI was conducted. The indices of attention, verbal memory, visual memory, and delayed recall were significantly elevated after stoppage of drug. And both verbal IQ and performance IQ were increased after stoppage of drug, too. SPECT and PET revealed significant improvement, which showed diffuse and generalized change, not localized change.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"chronic dementia in parkinson disease\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"discontinuation of anticholinergic drugs\", \"CureRate\": \"1.0\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"long-term use of anticholinergic drugs\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

The course of the disease deteriorated in 28% of the patients between start and finish of the study, but the result was sometimes incomplete or in some doubt. For patients receiving treatment, the annual incidence of coxarthropathy was 1 per cent. In patients with medullary involvement, indicated by spasmodic paraparesis during the initial assessment, oral disodium etidronate always had a curative effect. In patients with cranial involvement, the condition worsened fairly frequently, with hypoacusis arising or deteriorating in 29 per cent of the patients. Twenty three fractures occurred, including 8 in pagetic bone, with an incidence of respectively 5 and 1.7 per cent patient-years: the risk of fracture did not seem to be increased when etidronate was used at a low dose. Among the side effects observed, there was a delayed increase in bone pain in 12.5 per cent of the patients, the symptoms generally resolving except in one case where a fracture occurred.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"paget's disease\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"discontinuous courses of low-dose disodium etidronate\", \"CureRate\": \"0.76\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"etidronate disodium 5 mg/kg/d\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

Abdominal examination was not remarkable and plain abdominal X-ray was negative, while bloody stools and leukocytosis developed 7 hours later. Superior mesenteric embolism was highly suspected and emergency laparotomy was performed. Successful embolectomy was carried out through the distal approach and the patient recovered completely without requiring small bowel resection.

On the day of admission he was in a preshock state, and his pulmonary artery pressure was very high at 90/30 mmHg. Pulmonary blood perfusion scintigraphy showed multiple defects of isotope uptake. Immediately after the scintigraphy, pulmonary embolectomy was performed while using extracorporeal circulation. The operation was successful and his physical activity was markedly improved. After the operation, anti-coagulant and anti-platelet therapies were continued, but recurrence of pulmonary emboli was detected by scintigraphy, and some thrombi were found by venography in deep veins of the lower parts of both legs.

Computed tomographic (CT) scans revealed a large parasagittal mass, which was markedly and homogeneously enhanced by contrast material. Bilateral external carotid angiograms showed that the middle meningeal arteries supplied the tumor. Both CT and angiographic findings suggested a right frontal parasagittal meningioma. Catheter embolization with Ivalon (polyvinyl alcohol foam) particles was carried out prior to the planned surgery for the purpose of decreasing intraoperative hemorrhage from the tumor. However, her clinical symptoms began to improve 9 days after the embolization procedure, and surgery was decided against because of her advanced age and symptomatic improvement. Ten months after embolization, she was able to walk unassisted and CT scans showed a 60% reduction of the pre-embolization tumor size. Four years after embolization, she remained nearly asymptomatic despite some regrowth of the tumor.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"meningioma\", \"Symptoms\": [\"left sensorimotor disturbance\", \"unable to walk without a cane\"], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"embolization\", \"CureRate\": \"1.0\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [\"computed tomography (CT),Bilateral external carotid angiograms\"], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

However, it is only effective in some cases and at least 12 weeks is required before efficacy can be ascertained. In an attempt to achieve earlier assessment of response, changes in lymphocyte counts have been studied in patients receiving endocrine therapy. Absolute lymphocytes were not significantly changed by 6 weeks in any patients but there was a significant increase (P less than 0.05) in absolute T counts by 6 weeks in patients who achieved partial remission when compared with those whose disease continued to progress. Percentage T counts increased significantly from pretreatment values (P less than 0.002) in patients in whom disease progression was stopped by endocrine manipulation and this rise was maintained during clinical benefit. Fall in percentage T counts to pretreatment values predated objective evidence of recurrence by as much as 2 months. There was no increase in percentage T counts in patients in whom disease progression continued despite treatment, indicating that the rise in percentage T counts is a secondary phenomenon to tumour response. T-lymphocyte counts may permit earlier evaluation of the patient during treatment, allowing earlier selection of alternative treatment modalities.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"breast cancer\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"endocrinotherapy\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

The results of a neurological examination including an EEC recording as well as a skull roentgenogram, were unremarkable. The visual evoked potentials were grossly abnormal. A native and contrast CT scan visualized a tumour close to the suprasellar cisterna reaching the chiasma opticum. At the age of 1.2 years the tumours was removed. Histologically the tissue was identified as a hamartoma. Immediately after the operation vaginal bleeding ceased, pubertal development regressed, bone age did not advance any further, the visual evoked potentials normalized and the contrast CT did not show any tumour mass.

In conclusion, the early diagnosis and operation is the key for successful treatment of poststernotomy mediastinitis. Wider debridement including sternum and ribs with perioperative lavage by diluted povidone-iodine solution and antibiotic solution should be done aggressively, and the transfer of the major pectoral muscle flap and skin closure without postoperative irrigation is an effective method of choice.

Experience with 50 cases treated by means of extensive laminectomy, foraminotomy, and excision of osteophytes during the past 10 years.\nAbstract: This paper reviews management by means of the posterior approach of 50 patients with cervical myeloradiculopathy caused by spondylosis and stenosis of the spinal canal seen in the past 10 years. Careful selection of patients is an absolute necessity since a primary cause of failure occurred in individuals who subsequently proved to have motor neurone disease. Older individuals with long-standing neurological deficits, especially long tract signs indicative of fixed lesions, were benefited primarily by a lack of further progression of their disorder and occasional improvement in hand function and gait. Diagnostic evaluation should include electromyography, nerve conduction studies, and sensory evoked cortical potentials. With the introduction of the fourth generation CAT scanning equipment, additional diagnostic information is available regarding the internal configuration of the spinal canal, its contents, and the amount of available space at various levels. Supplementary myelography remains of basic importance. Laminectomy includes two levels above and below the areas of significant canal encroachment. Foraminal decompression with removal of only the innermost third of the foramen permits mobilization of the nerve roots, removal of osteophytes and untethering of the dural sac. A great deal of importance is attached to the preservation of the cervical lordotic curve since, with an adequate decompression and an intact dura, the cord moves dorsally into an expanded canal, rising above the ventrally situated osteophytes. In those patients with reversal of the cervical curve and swan neck deformities, posterior decompression has not been of value. Recent more radical procedures in such cases, such as vertebrectomy, remain to be evaluated. Any procedure which will permit further kyphotic deformity, such as laminectomy, is contraindicated. Eighty-five percent of the patients operated upon by the recommended surgical approach improved.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"cervical spondylotic myeloradiculopathy\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"extensive laminectomy, foraminotomy, and excision of osteophytes\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [\"electromyography,nerve conduction studies,sensory evoked cortical potentials,CAT scanning,myelography\"], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

The breast and regional nodes received 45 Gy of 60Co irradiation in 25 fractions over 5 weeks (45 Gy/25/5 wks). Electrons were used to deliver a further 15 Gy/7/1.5 weeks to the internal mammary chain and 25 Gy/11/2.5 weeks to the lower axilla. The primary tumor was boosted by Iridium 192 implant for a further 37 Gy prescribed at 85% of the basal dose rate (Paris system). Rigid needles were secured by templates in single plane (58/398) or double plane (340/398) geometry. Results of the 340 two-plane implants have been analyzed to look for a possible influence of dose rate on local control. Follow-up for patients free of local recurrence is 4-204 months (median: 92 months). The 340 tumors were divided into three groups according to dose rate: 0.32-0.49 Gy/hr (n = 95), 0.50-0.59 Gy/hr (n = 120), and 0.60-0.90 Gy/hr (n = 125). The three groups are statistically comparable according to age, tumor size, mean 60Co dose, mean Iridium dose, overall treatment time, and follow-up. The local failure rate in the three groups is 27% (26/95), 20% (24/120), and 13% (16/125) (p less than 0.03, Chi square). At 15 years the estimated local control (Kaplan Meier) is 60%, 72%, and 84% (p less than 0.02, Logrank), respectively. This analysis indicates that there is a significant effect of dose rate on local control for carcinoma of the breast treated by combined external beam (45 Gy) plus Iridium 192 implantation (37 Gy). To maximize local control the authors recommend an implant dose rate of greater than or equal to 0.6 Gy/hr.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"breast cancer\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"external beam irradiation plus iridium 192 implant\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

Conventional external pituitary irradiation for acromegaly produces a consistent, but slow, fall in elevated serum growth hormone (GH) levels. It has not been established whether such treatment is effective in preventing the development of cardiovascular complications. The evolution of cardiovascular disease has therefore been studied in 11 acromegalic patients followed up for a mean 10 years (range 3-17) after external pituitary irradiation. At the final follow-up fasting serum GH were significantly (P less than 0.01) lower than pre-irradiation levels, but cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, dysrhythmias, hypertension, major arterial disease, heart failure) increased significantly in prevalence (P less than 0.01) during this period. Electrocardiographic abnormalities also increased in prevalence. At the final follow-up 6 patients had cardiomegaly on chest X-ray and echocardiographs (10 patients) were abnormal in every case. All 11 patients had evidence of complete or partial anterior hypopituitarism. We confirm that external pituitary irradiation is effective in reducing elevated serum GH levels in acromegaly, but suggest that such a slow reduction in serum GH levels does not retard the development of cardiovascular complications.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"acromegaly\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"external pituitary irradiation\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [\"electrocardiographic,chest X-ray,echocardiographs\"], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

Fifty-five knees had only an anterior laxity and 166 anterior laxity combined with medial laxity, in 100 of which tensioning or reinforcement of the medial ligament was needed. Forty-two per cent of sporting patients were able to return to sport at the same level, though half of them had some discomfort. Fifty-one per cent of patients did not experience any instability in daily and working life but half of them had occasional pain. Sixty-one per cent of knees did not, at review, show a positive MacIntosh pivot shift test and the absence of pivot shift correlated statistically with the quality of the functional result. In seventy-three per cent of knees there was a positive Lachmantest indicating definite laxity at the review.

Ordinary mechanical ventilation was not enough to keep normal gas exchange. To sustain life, a venovenous extracorporeal lung assist, ECLA, with two Kolobow membrane lungs was performed.

We present a case of a nine-month-old infant who developed paroxysmal pulmonary hypertension associated with severe hypoxemia after the successful repair of a large perimembranous ventricular septal defect (VSD). The pulmonary hypertension was refractory to all medical and pharmacologic therapy but was successfully treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). On ECMO, pharmacologic support was removed, pulmonary artery pressure reduced, and ECMO support withdrawn. To date, ECMO has been applied to pulmonary hypertension of the newborn, neonatal respiratory insufficiency, and for primary cardiac pump failure. Our experience with this case leads us to believe it is an effective therapy for acute pulmonary hypertension occurring after the repair of congenital cardiac anomalies.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"pulmonary hypertension\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"after repair of ventricular septal defect\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

The major complication of this therapy is hemorrhage, with intracranial hemorrhage having the highest morbidity and mortality. Seizures, incisional bleeding and bleeding in the pleural space, hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, renal failure, and cardiovascular complications account for most of the other complications.

Free hemoglobin, glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) increased as a function of shock-wave count.

About two-thirds of the autotransplants were performed before percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) was established for clinical use. However, vascular disease at a site or type not suitable for PTA was present in 57 (90%) of the kidneys. Hypertension was the leading symptom in 56 patients, including four in whom renal autotransplantation was performed as an emergency for acute renal artery occlusion or malignant hypertension. Blood pressure returned to normal or improved in 51 (91%) and remained unchanged in five patients (9%) following autotransplantation. Three patients with renal artery aneurysm in whom haematuria and loin pain were the indications for treatment, became asymptomatic following surgical intervention. Bilateral renal autotransplantation was performed synchronously in one and sequentially in three patients. There were no operative deaths, but two kidneys were lost postoperatively in two 2-year-old children owing to renal vascular thrombosis. In the follow-up period (mean 4.3 years), one additional kidney was lost at 3 months owing to progressive FMD. Blood pressure and renal function remained stable in all other patients. Based on the excellent results achieved in this series, it is concluded that extracorporeal vascular repair and renal autotransplantation is a safe procedure for the patient as well as the kidney affected by FMD.

Eleven experimental and six control furcations, randomly assigned, are included in this report. The furcations were surgically exposed, using a flap approach and the areas were debrided. On the experimental teeth, Gore-Tex periodontal material was adapted and sutured, using a suspensory suture. The flaps were then sutured tightly, assuring complete coverage to the material. For 1 month all patients were seen weekly and rinsed their mouths with an 0.12% chlorhexidine solution daily. After 4 to 6 weeks the Gore-Tex membranes were removed. Clinical measurements were repeated at 3 and 6 months following surgery. Changes from baseline in PD and CAL were calculated for each case. Results indicated that PD measurements were reduced by both procedures, but the reduction was better for GTR at 3 and 6 months. At six months the test sites showed 2.8 +/- 1.0 mm pocket reduction, while the control sites showed an average of 1.6 +/- 0.9 mm reduction in pocket depth. CAL recordings were improved by both treatments, but were better for GTR at 6 months, with an average gain in CAL of 1.8 mm for the GTR and 0.6 mm for the controls.

Of these, 95 were personally examined. The surgical technique from 1968 to 1973 included a two-stage Harrington distraction, with fusion added at the second operation (52 patients). From 1973 to 1975, 48 patients were treated with a one-stage distraction and fusion after a week of preoperative Cotrel traction. Postoperatively, all patients were treated with a Milwaukee brace. A spinal examination and functional assessment, including a questionnaire and pain drawing, full standing anterior-posterior (AP), and lateral roentgenograms of the spine, was performed by independent observers. Eighty-five subjects without scoliosis served as a control group. The radiographic evaluation showed the usual nearly 50% permanent correction at the follow-up examination averaging nine years postoperatively.

Epileptic seizures occurred in the left extremities and recurred several tens of times daily despite intensive pharmacological treatment. EEG investigations demonstrated seizure activity in the right motor-parietal-temporal area. Stereotaxic destruction of Forel's field and thalamus on the right side gave only brief improvement lasting several days. In view of this the frontal, temporal and a part of the parietal lobe were removed according to electrocorticographic investigations. During 6 months after the operation epileptic attacks were absent, than they recurred with increasing frequency. After 10 months full hemispherectomy was done. The child tolerated the operation very well, and control examination after 2 years showed disappearance of epileptic attacks and considerable compensation of motor power loss and sensory disturbances in the left extremities. The authors believe that hemispherectomy carried out in two stages at an interval of several months is better tolerated by the patients and makes possible better compensation of functional disturbances than classic hemispherectomy.

During HDF, despite a significant reduction of the dialysis time, all patients had a significant decrease of predialytic BUN and serum creatinine, and a significant improvement of anemia. Furthermore, a close direct correlation was detected between the percent increase of hemoglobin and the length of time on HDF.

The authors report here five cases. Three patients were initially with a cardiovascular collapse and all had an acute renal failure. Sodium bicarbonate haemodialysis therapy led to a dramatic improvement. Consciousness and hemodynamic status recovered rapidly. Severe metabolic and blood gases derangements were also rapidly corrected. Plasma metformin removal, appreciated by repeated blood samplings in 3 cases, was satisfactory. All patients survived. However, blood metformin levels remained abnormally high at the end of the dialytic therapy. In conclusion, (1) bicarbonate dialysis is an adequate treatment of lactic acidosis observed in diabetic patients treated with metformin since it rapidly corrects the acid-base disorders and partially removes metformin; (2) the sole accumulation of metformin is not sufficient to explain lactic acidosis since this latter might be corrected in spite of persisting high levels of blood metformin.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"lactic acidosis\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"hemodialysis\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

The convulsions disappeared on day 4; the patient regained consciousness on day l2 and recovered with slight sequelae. Toxicokinetic studies were conducted for a period of 12 days. The lithium (Li) serum concentration fell from 4.4 mmol/l on admission to 2.16 before HD and 0.35 after three HD. Li serum half life was 54 hours before HD, 25 hours during the three days on which HD was carried out and 106 hours thereafter. The Li cerebrospinal fluid/Li serum ratio ranged between 0.4 and 0.6 and was not influenced by HD. Mean renal clearance was 10.6 ml per min. During hemodialysis, Li serum half life decreased to 3.5 - 4.9 hours and clearance was 108 ml/min. A total amount of l28.6 mmol lithium was excreted; 84.3 mmol by HD and 44.3 mmol in urine. Patient's clinical course and electroencephalographic signs were correlated with the calculated cellular pool of Li but not with Li serum concentrations.

The variations of serum and urinary beta-2m were studied in 51 uraemic patients chronically dialyzed by means of dialyzers with cuprophan membrane, the average duration of the HD treatment being of 51.5 months. The pre- and postdialysis values of the beta-2-m were determined by Mancini radial immunodiffusion. A considerable increase--about 25 times--of serum beta-2-m was observed, which was more marked in anuric patients and those with a duration of more than 5 years of HD treatment. Among these, 15.7% show various articular manifestations (detected clinically and radiologically): a carpal tunnel syndrome (one patient required surgery) and arthropathies with various sites (scapulohumeral, knee). During a HD sitting with cuprophan membrane dialyzers, an increase of beta-Z-m was recorded, but it was statistically non-significant.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"chronic renal insufficiency\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"hemodialysis\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

Nine patients (36%) underwent repeated surgery in order to ensure adequate successful vascular access for haemodialysis, whilst only 14.1% of patients suffering from renal insifficiency of another cause had to undergo operation on more than one occasion in order to be treated. In the majority of cases vasospasm was responsible for the obliteration of internal or external arterio-venous shunts. It was particularly common in women with a normal or low blood pressure. In this group, 3/4 of the patients needed several operations in order to make dialysis possible. Fourteen patients underwent bilateral nephrectomy. One death occurred in a patient who had received a renal transplant during the same operation. Fifteen kidney grafts were carried out and percentages of functional transplants at one and two years were 45.4 and 37.8% respectively. These poor results may be explained by the fact that 13 of our 15 patients were aged more than 40 years.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"polycystic kidney\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"hemodialysis and kidney transplantation\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

The diagnosis of tuberous sclerosis was ascertained by the association of typical cutaneous retinal and osseous lesions. On the contrary, the renal localisations were unusual. Early hypertension was exacerbated in the course of 2 pregnancies but was never severe. It preceded the late onset of renal failure which progressed slowly. The kidneys were small, with a peculiar angiographic aspect: the renal tissue was not invaded by hamartomas but the whole arterial bed was diffusely modified, with a cortical perfusion defect. Both kidneys were studied after bilateral nephrectomy. The lesions were far more complex than a simple replacement of the renal tissue by angiomyolipomas: they involved the vessels, the interstitium (with lipids inclusions surrounded by a macrophagic reaction) and the glomeruli (with focal and segmental sclerosis). This observation (which is the 11th case in the literature of tuberous sclerosis with chronic renal failure and the 3rd treated by transplantation) documents a particular variety of congenital and familial nephropathy with delayed revelation.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"tuberous sclerosis with chronic renal failure\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"hemodialysis and transplantation\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"early hypertension exacerbated during 2 pregnancies, mild renal failure progression\"}]}"}]}

In 10 adult patients with severe type II hyperlipoproteinemia, a single HELP treatment of 3 1 plasma led to an acute decrease in the average plasma viscosity (PV) from 1.30 to 1.1 mPas. At the same time, an even more marked decrease in the mean erythrocyte aggregation rate from a pathological value of 7.9% to a value of 3.7% (normal range less than 5%) was observed. Long-term studies on five patients demonstrated a lasting improvement in these two haemorheological variables. The acute rheological changes were also accompanied by an improvement in polarographically determined muscle oxygen tension. Mean oxygen tension values measured in both the m.biceps brachii and the m.tibialis anterior in five patients before and after a single HELP treatment increased from 30 +/- 4 to 37 +/- 7 mmHg and from 27 +/- 2 to 31 +/- 3 mmHg respectively.

Ten of them were treated prospectively with a radiation-chemotherapy protocol. All but four specimens were recently reexamined and classified according to the Working Formulation system. The predominant histologic types were diffuse large cell type, large cell immunoblastic type, and diffuse mixed small and large cell type, seen in 38%, 21%, and 21% of cases, respectively. Before 1980, 16 patients were treated with postoperative radiation without definite chemotherapy, and only one has survived more than 5 years. Local recurrence was the most common cause of failure. In 1981, the authors started a protocol in which four to six courses of systemic chemotherapy with vincristine, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and prednisolone (VEPA) was given after whole brain radiation (30-40 Gy) with a local boost up to 50 to 60 Gy. Eight patients completed this protocol, and all of them are alive at 16 to 100 months after diagnosis, with three patients surviving more than 5 years. Only one patient developed recurrence. On the other hand, six patients who did not complete or receive chemotherapy after 1981 are dead or alive with recurrence. Correlation between the Working Formulation subtype and prognosis was not clear because of the variety of treatment. Two patients receiving chemotherapy developed brain necrosis, which was fatal in one case, and the other two patients treated with the protocol are in a poor state without signs of recurrence. Chemotherapy may enhance the radiation effect on normal brain tissue as well as tumor. Combination of radiotherapy and chemotherapy can improve the survival rate, but the optimal dosage needs to be investigated further.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"primary intracranial lymphoma\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"high dose radiation and systemic vincristine-doxorubicin-cyclophosphamide-prednisolone chemotherapy\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

The mean duration of respiratory symptoms was 17 months. In 66 adults, asthma was the most frequent indication for surgery. The mean duration of respiratory symptoms was 9.7 years. Suppression of reflux was obtained by operation in 95% of infants and children, with disappearance of respiratory disorders in 78.6% and clinical improvement of symptoms in 16.4%.

To determine whether iron overload leads to insulin resistance before the development of insulin deficiency, insulin was infused (by euglycemic insulin-clamp technique) into 12 children with thalassemia (4 of whom were prepubertal, and 8 pubertal) who had normal or only moderately impaired glucose tolerance and who were receiving chelation therapy. Although insulin-stimulated glucose metabolism in the prepubertal children with thalassemia was similar to that in controls (normal prepubertal children) (319 +/- 23 vs. 314 +/- 41 mg per square meter of body-surface area per minute, P not significant), the response to insulin was markedly impaired in the pubertal children with thalassemia (155 +/- 18 vs. 224 +/- 15 mg per square meter per minute in normal pubertal controls, P less than 0.01). Plasma insulin levels rose excessively after oral glucose administration in the pubertal subjects with thalassemia, but not in the prepubertal patients (P less than 0.001). Furthermore, in response to a standard hyperglycemic stimulus, insulin levels in the pubertal patients rose to two to three times greater than normal and C-peptide levels became significantly elevated. Our data suggest that insulin resistance and increased insulin secretion develop in older children with thalassemia treated with long-term hypertransfusion therapy before the development of diabetes.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"thalassemia\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"hypertransfusion\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

Of the total number, 21% had an excellent response to treatment, becoming completely free from asthma and requiring no drug therapy. A further 33% had a good response, with worthwhile decrease in frequency and severity of the attacks of asthma, or a decrease in drug requirements. About half of the 46% who had a poor response had a marked subjective improvement in general well-being. Statistical evaluation of the six variables (age, sex, result, trance depth, psychological factors and severity of the asthma) confirmed the clinical impression that the ability to go into a deep trance (closely associated with the youthfulness of the subject) gives the best possibility of improvement, especially if there are significant aetiological psychological factors present and the asthma is not severe.

There were no significant differences in either the follicular phase or luteal phase hormonal profiles of estradiol and progesterone, but there was a significantly reduced pregnancy rate in those women with severe endometriosis. In part, this was due to the recovery of fewer oocytes from the endometriosis patients (P less than 0.001) despite the fact that the peak estradiol levels and ovarian accessibility were similar in the two groups.

Four cases are described in which holding a retarded, ruminating child for 10-15 min before, during, and after meals, was associated with remission of rumination. Simple holding was effective in three; in the fourth, it was necessary to punish the child by putting her into a separate room for 3 min immediately after regurgitation. A within-subject reversal experimental design suggested that holding and not simple distraction was the effective component of the treatment. Treatment benefits were well maintained when the child returned to a home environment in which he or she continued to be held periodically. It is proposed that there are two behavioral etiologies for idiopathic rumination syndrome--social deprivation and reward learning through increased attention for regurgitation.

These complexes have been used to treat Dpt-hypersensitive patients who suffered from chronic bronchial asthma. Clinical symptoms and medication intake were followed by filling in diary cards. Peak expiratory flow, measured four times a day, was also followed. Intradermal skin tests and bronchial challenge tests were performed with allergen together with an evaluation of nonspecific bronchial reactivity. Specific IgE and IgG antibodies were assayed after separation from the bulk of serum immunoglobulins by immunoadsorption. The study was carried out over two years according to a double-blind protocol. Intradermal inoculation of antigen-antibody complexes resulted in a marked reduction of both clinical and medication scores. No systemic side-effects were observed and only mild wheal and flare reactions were noted at the injection site. The treatment showed a drastic reduction of specific skin and bronchial reactivities with only marginal effects on nonspecific bronchial reactivity. Concentrations of specific IgE antibodies decreased significantly during the first weeks of treatment and remained at these lower values throughout the study. Specific IgG antibodies actually decreased in the majority of treated patients. The total amount of allergen used in this study was less than 1% of the amount currently used for conventional hyposensitization with the same allergen. These findings show that antigen-antibody complex inoculation is an efficient and safe means of treating allergic bronchial asthma and that the mechanism of action is likely to differ from conventional hyposensitization.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"allergic bronchial asthma\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"inoculation of allergen-antibody complexes\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

Median age was 54, and M/F 1.3. At diagnosis, 26 patients had refractory anaemia with an excess of blasts in transformation (RAEB-T) three had refractory anaemia (RA), 11 had refractory anaemia with excessive blasts (RAEB) and seven had chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML). Treatment was started within 3 months of diagnosis in 30 patients, and after more than 3 months in the 17 remaining patients. At the onset of treatment, 16 patients had progressed to acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Twenty-two patients (47%) reached complete remission (CR), 10 (21%) had hypoplastic death and 15 (32%) had resistant disease. Median actuarial disease-free interval was 11 months. Median actuarial survival was 14 months from diagnosis and 10 months from the onset of treatment. A significantly higher CR rate was found in patients with RAEB-T at diagnosis (69% v 19% in patients with other FAB subtypes: P = 0.008), and in patients treated within 3 months of diagnosis. Using multivariate analysis, RAEB-T at diagnosis emerged as the most powerful prognostic factor of CR achievement. Karyotype was the only significant prognostic factor of disease-free interval, with a median of 16.5 months in patients with normal karyotype versus 4 months in patients with normal findings (P = 0.018). A subgroup of 15 patients with RAEB-T at diagnosis and normal karyotype, who had a CR rate of 80% and a median actuarial disease-free interval of 18 months, could be identified. Our results confirm that, overall, intensive chemotherapy has limited efficacy in MDS, especially when compared with allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Relatively favourable results were obtained in our patients with RAEB-T at diagnosis, however, particularly those with normal karyotype. In that subgroup, intensive chemotherapy may be recommended, especially before BMT, as a high risk of relapse after BMT in patients with RAEB-T allografted as first line therapy has been reported.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"myelodysplastic syndromes\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"intensive chemotherapy\", \"CureRate\": \"0.47\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

The patient was successfully treated with interferon-alpha (IF-alpha). In the fifth year of treatment with IF-alpha the morphology of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and of bone marrow infiltration changed with the appearance of numerous small to intermediate shaped lymphocytes of a T-helper phenotype.

Although some successful reports of intra-arterial chemotherapy for HCC. have been documented, most of the therapeutic effects are transient and the survival rate is not satisfactory. This report is of a rare case, that of a long-term survivor with HCC treated by intra-arterial chemotherapy and immunotherapy. A 66-year-old man, with a 10-year history of liver cirrhosis was admitted to The Center for Adult Diseases, Osaka, after detection of a tumor in the right lobe on US. On admission, serum AFP was within normal range, HBs-Ag was negative, and ICG-R 15 was 20.8%. On hepatic angiogram, a hypervascular tumor (6 cm in size) was recognized in the middle of the right lobe. He was assessed as unresectable because of insufficient reserve capacity, and the catheterization of the hepatic artery for intra-arterial chemotherapy and the injection 35 KE of OK-432 into the tumor were carried out under laparotomy.

CDDP (30 mg/day) and Etoposide (60 mg/day) were given once every 5 days, and then 5-FU(250 mg/day) was infused daily for 26 days. The patient underwent this protocol study twice in 3 months. After the intraarterial infusion, transarterial embolization using CDDP (100 mg) powder added to lipiodol and aluminum stearate as suspension was done a month later. The tumor regression rate was 84% after intraarterial infusion of CDDP, Etoposide and 5-FU. The tumor thrombus in the intrahepatic portal vein and IVC had completely disappeared. We could not find lipiodol accumulated in the tumor after TAE. Thus, we assumed that the remaining tumor was a necrotic scar and that a complete response was obtained in the patient.

ADR at a dose of 20 mg and MMC at 10 mg were administered through the hepatic artery or peripheral vein during hemodialysis. ADR and MMC became undetectable after 24 hours and 2 hours, respectively. On the other hand, while MMC was detected in dialysate, but ADR was not. Consequently, it was speculated smaller molecular weight of MMC (334.34) than that of ADR (579.99) might be responsible for the appearance of MMC in dialysate.

The infection rate was 0.4 per cent, and the nonunion rate was 0.8 per cent. Shortening of more than 2 cm. was seen in seven cases (3 per cent), and malrotation of more than 20 degrees was noted in four cases (1.7 per cent). These more common problems of shortening and rotation were almost eliminated by the increased use of cerclage wire and postoperative traction and spica casts. Knee range of motion averaged 128 degrees. These fractures provide interesting and difficult challenges. Intramedullary nailing of the segmental fractures is technically demanding but offers excellent results in these otherwise difficult fractures. Patients with grade I and grade II comminuted fractures do well with intramedullary nailing and the bones remain stable. Grade III and grade IV comminuted fractures are unstable and pose the risk of shortening and rotation. Therefore, to gain anatomic restoration in a young person we believe that it is reasonable to perform an open reduction and cerclage wiring of these fractures. The postoperative treatment of the comminuted femoral fracture is determined by both fracture stability and patient reliability, and frequent roentgenograms are indicated.

The study was carried out on 45 female patients, aged between 34 and 61 years, undergoing cholecystectomy who were randomly divided into three groups. Group 1 (age: 50.33 +/- 8.64 years) received 100 ml of 5% mannitol solution i.v.; group 2 (age: 49.80 +/- 11.11 years) 100 ml of a mannitol solution containing 7.5 mg/kg L-tryptophan; and group 3 (age: 53.46 +/- 9.60 years) 100 ml of a mannitol solution containing 15 mg/kg L-tryptophan. Vital capacity (preoperative VC) was measured before surgery. Anesthesia used was isoflurane. Narcotics or neuroleptics were not used. Pain was assessed before treatment (T-0 min), at the end of administration (T-30) and at T-60, 120, 180, 240, 300 and 360 min by the following variables: respiratory rate (RR), heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP), Scott-Huskisson test (VAS), pain vital capacity (PVC), analgesic vital capacity (AVC), and respiratory restoration factor (RRF) calculated from Bromage's formula (RRF = (AVC - PVC/preoperative VC - PVC) X 100). As regards variables RR, HR, MAP and VAS, differences between the values from T-30 to T-360 and the value at T-0 were calculated. Means and S.E.M. were calculated on the obtained values and on RRF values for each group. The significance of the differences between groups was calculated using Student's t test and Bonferroni's test. Results show a significant decrease of pain in groups 2 and 3 treated with L-tryptophan, in comparison with group 1 (controls). No significant difference was observed between the treated groups, although more lasting pain relief was observed in group 3 in comparison with group 2. Intravenous L-tryptophan showed its effectiveness in the treatment of postoperative pain even when used alone.

Treatments were 15 rad given twice weekly, calculated to midpelvis, to a total dose of 150 rad.

During recent years, encouraging results have been reported when surgery has been performed. Therefore, an effort was made to compare different treatment principles on the basis of a study on patients treated by irradiation. This retrospective study comprised 37 patients over a 20-year period. The relative 5-year survival was 33%. Most of the patients died in the next two years after diagnosis. Seventy-three percent of the patients initially had signs of regional metastasis. Hardly 20% of these were still alive after 5 years, while patients without evidence of metastasis had a 5-year survival of 50%. Neither the size, nor the histopathological features of the primary tumor seemed to affect the incidence of regional metastasis. The duration of symptoms before diagnosis, however, seemed to influence prognosis. Surgical consideration alone, or in combination with irradiation, should be made in cases with large primary tumor with regional lymph node involvement. In other cases, however, there was no evidence suggesting surgery as a better form of therapy than irradiation alone.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"tonsillar region carcinoma\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"irradiation\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

A prolonged chest pain (more than two hours) with a major electrocardiographic lesion in the posterior leads needed an urgent coronary arteriography in order to attempt a recanalization. Antecedents of arteriopathy of the lower limbs with aortobifemoral bypass required an axillary artery right side approach. A selective right coronary opacification showed complete occlusion at the junction of segments 1 and 2. An intracoronary injection of isosorbide dinitrate relieved a coronary spasm and allowed a complete visualization of the right coronary artery. This appeared to be very atherosclerotic with several severe narrowings, and a subocclusive lesion at the site of the initial occlusion. Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasties (PTCA) were performed and led to real 'restructuring' of the right coronary artery. The clinical outcome was excellent without recurrent angina pectoris. An angiographic control performed 6 months after PTCA demonstrated the persistence of the coronary recanalization and an evident improvement of the segmental contractility. This report emphasizes the role of coronary spasm in the genesis of myocardial infarction and shows that PTCA may be performed as a first approach at the acute phase of myocardial infarction; to our knowledge it is the first PTCA performed by an axillary approach at the acute stage of myocardial infarction.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"myocardial infarction\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"isosorbide dinitrate, transluminal angioplasty\", \"CureRate\": \"1.0\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [\"coronary angiography,intracoronary injection of isosorbide dinitrate\"], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

There have been a few reports on treatment with CO2-, argon- or Nd-YAG-lasers, which have been encouraging. Ten patients with Osler's disease were treated for severe epistaxis. Three were treated with CO2-laser, two of these under general anaesthesia. Seven patients were treated with the argon laser under local anaesthesia. A variety of other sites were treated at the same time for functional or cosmetic reasons (mouth, face, fingers, rectum). Good results were obtained in eight cases. In three of the cases the observation period was more than two years. A second treatment has been necessary in three cases. Two other patients were treated recently, and it is too early to judge the results. The argon-laser is more convenient for this purpose than the CO2-laser.

Among side effects, oncogenic problem and late radiation change are most undesirable and may become fatal. Hence, we avoid radiation therapy especially for younger aged patients. We prefer surgical therapy to radiotherapy for such a case. In our clinic, laser therapy has been employed. A laser beam is introduced through an operation microscope and a lesion can be microscopically vaporized. In this study, a survey of 40 patients with T1 glottic cancer submitted to laser surgery was reviewed. From those patients 25 were T1a and 15 were T1b. From our experience, laser vaporization is recommendable for T1 glottic cancer in younger aged patients.

In this multi-institute non-randomized study, the five-year cumulative survival rate was 70% for the former group and 49% for the latter. The prognosis was more favorable among patients who responded to preoperative chemotherapy than among those who did not. Limb-salvage surgery was feasible for most of the surgical stage IIB patients with small extraosseous tumor extensions who had responded to preoperative chemotherapy. Local tumor recurrences were seen in 15 (14%) of the 107 patients in the limb-salvage surgery group, nine of whom died of the metastasis. While limb-salvage surgery is being increasingly used in Japan, present indications show the procedure not to reduce survival rate for osteosarcoma patients. The survival rate of patients with wide-with-marginal margins was similar to that of patients with wide margins.

At least 1 cm of normal parenchyma surrounded the tumour and no microscopic invasion of resection margins was evident. The disease was staged according to our own staging system. Lobectomy was performed in 50 patients and non-anatomical resection in the remainder. The postoperative mortality rate was 5 per cent and the major morbidity rate was 11 per cent. The actuarial 5-year survival rate for patients in stages I, II and III was 42 per cent, 34 per cent and 15 per cent respectively (P less than 0.001). The overall actuarial 5-year survival rate was 30 per cent. The prognostic importance of various patient and tumour variables was evaluated by univariate analysis and then by multivariate analysis. Age of patient, site of primary, disease-free interval between treatment of primary and of hepatic metastases, preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen levels, and number of metastases, did not relate to prognosis, while sex (P = 0.024), stage of primary (P = 0.026), extent of liver involvement (P less than 0.001), distribution of metastases (P = 0.01) and type of surgery (P = 0.028) significantly affected prognosis as single factors. Multivariate analysis revealed that only the extent of liver involvement and stage of the primary tumour were independent predictors of survival. We conclude that liver resection is effective in selected patients with hepatic metastases from colorectal cancer. In resectable patients it is not yet possible to formulate a clear prognosis based on clinical factors. The extent of liver involvement and the staging system used may be significant, although not absolute, indicators of outcome.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"hepatic metastases from colorectal cancer\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"liver resection\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

These cases ranged from 24-72 years of age (average 42), 11 were males and 12 females. There were 19 primary cases and 4 postoperative cases of recurrence, and the period of their clinical courses ranged from 2 months to 23 years. Concerning the operative procedure, in 22 cases the approach was via an upper midline incision and 1 case the approach was via left thoraco-abdominal incision. Intraoperative manometry was performed to help in judging the extent of each manipulation. With the operative manipulation, the LESP is reduced to 13.0 +/- 6.0 mmHg (39% of the average preoperative value) and HPZ is elongated to 60.9 +/- 14.1 mm (155% of the average preoperative value). Moreover, post-operative manometry data resembled intra-operative data. The effectiveness of the procedure is judged on the basis of the chief complaints, esophagography, endoscopic examination, esophageal manometry and 24-hr pH monitoring. Patients are followed up at 2 weeks, 3 months and 1 year from the operation. Results showed 22 excellent cases (96.65%), 1 fair case (4.34%). These are better results than those of other reports that showed 50-60% excellent results and 30% good results (remaining slight passage disturbance). The reason for this difference is that we obtain sufficient LESP decompression effect (myotomy + submucosal layer ablation) based on intraoperative manometry. In the only case that we judged as fair (a reoperated case after Heller's operation) showed severe EGR totalling 213 min. on 24-hr pH monitoring of the esophagus in the postoperative period and was erosion also seen in the lower esophagus endoscopically. In this case, the LESP was 6.0 mmHg and its HPZ is 27.0 mm, showing a higher HPZ than the non-reflux group. Among the non-reflux group, LESP was as low as 6.0 mmHg, and this case had a remarkable long HPZ of 57.0 mm. In conclusion, even though the LESP is low, it is possible to prevent reflux if the HPZ is sufficiently long.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"esophageal achalasia\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"long myotomy + partial fundopexy + posterior fixation based on intraoperative manometry\", \"CureRate\": \"0.9665\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

Radiating pain and weakness occurred when she tried to stand up on Dec. 25 in 1989. She was admitted to our hospital in October 1990. Physical examination showed emaciation, hypesthesia of extremities, hypesthesia over the right chest and back, impaired vibration and position sense, and hyperreflexia. Laboratory findings revealed that the erythrocyte sedimentation rate was elevated to 46mm/hr, rheumatoid factor (RF) to 83.1IU/ml and CRP to 3.7mg/dl. Her blood sugar was high and she was diagnosed as having diabetes mellitus. Cervical X ray film showed atlanto-axial subluxation. A pseudotumor around the odontoid process bulging into the spinal canal and compression of the upper cervical cord was observed by MRI. In spite of administration of bucillamine (100mg/day), the size of pseudotumor did not change. Methotrexate (MTX) at a dose of 5mg/week was started in February 1991 and the pseudotumor decreased in size with a concurrent reduction of ESR, RF and CRP. However, the high intensity lesion by T2 weighed image did not change and dysesthesia persisted. The pseudotumor was thought to be due to pannus and it was revealed that MTX was effective for reduction.

To determine if lesions that are likely to recur may be predicted at the time of surgery, data from 5020 patients with 7010 basal-cell carcinomas treated with Mohs' technique were reviewed. Two thousand nine hundred sixty (2960) lesions with five-year follow-up were studied (overall recurrence rate = 2.6%). Sex and age of the patients, size and location of lesions, types of previous therapy, and the number of surgical stages of microscopically controlled excision were all found to correlate significantly with recurrence rate (p less than 0.01). Multiple regression analysis was performed to determine the relative contribution of each of these variables to predictability of recurrences by a weighted scoring system. The derived model delineated the lesions into no-risk, low-, medium-, and high-risk groupings (p less than 0.000001). Lesions in the high-risk group had a recurrence rate of 10.1%, almost four times greater than the average.

In the following years the right orbicularis oris muscle and platysma were unilaterally and progressively involved in the spasms and with increasing frequency. Medical treatment with minor transquilizer was not effective. She was referred to our department at the age of 16. CT and MRI revealed no abnormality. Angiographical study revealed that the right PICA (posterior inferior cerebellar artery) was tourtously coming off from a relatively high portion of the right vertebral artery. The trunk of the right AICA (anterior inferior cerebellar artery) was not able to be identified. Although the onset of this condition was unusually early, the clinical course and symptoms of hemifacial spasm were so clearly typical that she underwent microvascular decompression surgery on July 26, 1988, at the age of 16. During the operation an upward looping PICA was found crossing and tightly compressing the exit zone of the right facial nerve. The offending artery seemed to be elastic without significant atherosclerotic change. The arterial loop was carefully dissected and replaced with two pieces of sponge prosthesis between the artery and the surface of brain stem. Her hemifacial spasm completely disappeared post-operatively. No recurrence has been noted for over one year in the follow-up observation. Hemifacial spasm is subacutely or chronically a progressive disorder of facial involuntary movement. The arterial compression in the exit zone of the facial nerve is said to be the cause of the disorder and microvascular decompression has been indicated for it since a little before the beginning of this decade.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"juvenile hemifacial spasm\", \"Symptoms\": [\"intermittent involuntary spasms of the right lower orbicularis oculi muscle\"], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"microvascular decompression surgery\", \"CureRate\": \"1.0\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [\"computed tomography (CT),magnetic resonance imaging (MRI),angiography\"], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

Twenty patients with hamstring muscle strains were assigned randomly to an Experimental Group (n = 10) or a Control Group (n = 10). Peak torque production of the quadriceps femoris and hamstring muscles and hamstring muscle length were measured before and after treatment. The hamstring muscles of the Experimental and Control groups were treated with moist heat followed by passive stretching. The Experimental Group also received manipulation of the sacroiliac joint. The change in hamstring muscle peak torque was significantly greater for the Experimental Group than for the Control Group (p less than .005). No significant differences existed between the two groups in either quadriceps femoris muscle peak torque or hamstring muscle length.

All fractures united in an average traction period of 28 days. Clinical and radiological reevaluation 2-10 years after treatment showed that fracture location, age, and overriding significantly affected overgrowth, whereas the length of the follow-up period and the direction of angular deformity affected correction of angulation. The following conclusions were reached: Distraction should be avoided, and overriding of up to 15 mm can be compensated for by growth acceleration. Initial angular deformities of up to 20 degrees in the coronal plane and up to 30 degrees in the sagittal plane will end in a satisfactory outcome.

The cases were collected through a cooperative effort of 57 surgeons at eight hospitals in the Detroit area and coordinated by the Michigan Cancer Foundation where data collection and analyses were completed. The primary treatment of all patients was a modified radical mastectomy. Of the 1,078 cases accessioned between October 1975 and April 1983, 537 were found to have no microscopic lymph node involvement and 462 of these cases received no adjuvant antineoplastic therapy. The period of follow-up of these cases (alive, n = 358) has been 78.75 +/- 24.6 months (mean +/- SD). Overall, the cumulative 6-year recurrence rate as calculated by life table analysis was 26%, with 16.8% dying of their disease. Tumor size was an important prognostic factor; the recurrence rate was 16.2% for those with primaries measuring less than or equal to 1 cm, with only a 6.3% mortality. Patients with tumors measuring greater than 5 cm also did well: 13.7% recurrence and 13.7% mortality rates at 6 years. The premenopausal women did slightly, but not statistically significantly, better than those who were postmenopausal. The presence or absence of quantifiable estrogen receptor protein (ER) was of little predictive value as far as rates of recurrence were concerned, but patients with an ER-positive tumor survived significantly longer. In postmenopausal women, those whose tumor lacked ER (n = 112) fared poorly: 30.4% experienced a recurrence by 6 years and 28% died of their disease. Recurrence rates and death rates were also high in a small group (n = 35) of postmenopausal women with ER+ tumors exhibiting nuclear pleomorphism (nuclear grade [NG]3) (38% and 24.3%, respectively).

There were 10 hemispherectomies, 32 temporal lobectomies and eight operations to other areas of the brain. The median age at operation was 14 years. 29 patients were found to have mesial temporal sclerosis or sclerotic hemispheres and 17 had alien tissue and one sclerosis with heterotopia. No lesion was found in three cases. The nature of the first seizure was found to relate significantly to pathology. 30 patients had suffered an early convulsion. Between the convulsive insult and the onset of focal epilepsy there was a silent interval, the duration of which was biased by sex and side of lesion. The remaining 20 patients, of whom a highly significant number had alien tissue, had not had an early convulsion before the onset of focal epilepsy. The importance of accurate clinical histories is stressed. Clinical considerations alone predicted the pathology and laterality of the lesion in more than half the series. Regular EEG recordings and repeat scanning were found to be important investigations. Major disorders of behaviour had occurred in 44 patients. As adults, the series were free of severe psychiatric symptoms, but many required years of careful rehabilitation. 31 children had been excluded from normal schools before operation. Postoperatively, many patients continued their education in normal schools. Some required basic remedial teaching, others successfully undertook higher education and training. 49 patients benefited over-all from neurosurgical treatment. 34 had no more habitual epilepsy at all.

Review of 345 consecutive cases treated over a period of 12 years.\nAbstract: This paper reports experience with 345 patients admitted to a neurosurgical department after an aneurysm rupture. At the time of admission, patients were separated into two groups: the patients unsuitable for planned surgery and called 'unoperable'; the patients planned for surgery and called 'operable patients' (328 patients). The general management attitude consisted of deferred surgery according to the clinical status of the patients and the risk of vasospasm and ischaemia. Of these, 18 died before the day of surgery, and are called 'operable and non-operated' patients. The cause of death was vasospasm and ischaemia in 10 cases and recurrence of haemorrhage in 8 cases. 310 patients were actually operated upon. Their final outcome was: good 70%, fair 9.6%, poor 7.7%, death 12.5%.

Fat absorption and intestinal mucosal morphology were normal in all 5. 2 children were given nutritional supplementation by nasogastric intubation, 1 received nightly oral formula supplements, and 2 were supplemented with zinc, iron, folate, and vitamin E only. Nutritional supplementation by the nasogastric route produced a rapid sustained increase in growth rate, associated with striking reductions in pain crises and infections which had previously necessitated many hospital admissions. Oral supplementation improved the clinical course but had no effect on growth rate. Mineral and vitamin supplements influenced neither the growth rate nor the clinical course.

Deformity and bone loss treated by open reduction, internal fixation, and human bone morphogenetic protein (hBMP).\nAbstract: Four patients with severely deformed nonunions of the distal end of the tibia failed to respond to standard surgical methods and were successfully treated as follows: debridement of fibrous tissue, sequestrectomy, correction of angulatory deformities, internal stabilization, and implantation of human bone morphogenetic protein (hBMP). After resection of the sequestra, all four patients had significant bone defects of the anterior tibial cortex extending to the ankle joint. The average number of failed previous surgical procedures was 5.8. The average patient age was 35.3 years. The intervals of nonunion averaged 24.8 months. In two patients, the hBMP, including other low molecular weight bone matrix noncollagenous proteins (hBMP/NCP), was implanted across the fracture site in polylactic-polyglycollic acid strips (1 X 13 cm) as an onlay graft. In one patient, the BMP was implanted in the fracture gap in absorbable gelatin (No. 5 capsules). In another patient, the BMP/NCP was also implanted in the form of a composite of cortical allogeneic bone in addition to a capsule of BMP/NCP. In all four cases, alignment was restored and the bone ends were stabilized with internal fixation. Preoperatively, the ankle joints were ankylosed and painful. Healed fractures and functional ankle joints were observed in three of four patients at an average of 4.4 months. In one patient, the fracture healed but the joint remained ankylosed. Although a randomized double-blind consecutive series of matched cases is necessary to prove the efficacy of hBMP, implants of hBMP combined with skillful surgical treatment are under investigation in the interim as an alternative to amputation.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"distal metaphyseal tibial nonunion\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"open reduction, internal fixation, and human bone morphogenetic protein\", \"CureRate\": \"0.75\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

Early open thoracotomy to eliminate the empyema with decortication of the fibrinous peel and reexpansion of the lung has proven safe and effective for 25 years. The goals of treatment of acute nontuberculous empyema are: (1) to save life, (2) to eliminate the empyema, (3) to reexpand the trapped lung, (4) to restore mobility of the chest wall and diaphragm, (5) to return respiratory function to normal, (6) to eliminate complications or chronicity, and (7) to reduce the duration of hospital stay. Our studies confirm the normal values to be expected in patients who have had complete recovery from the acute empyema, and we lay to rest any concern that decortication might, in time, limit pulmonary function.

A 47-year-old male with constrictive pericarditis and rheumatic valvular heart disease was successfully treated with operation. The valvular dysfunction had included aortic, mitral and tricuspid regurgitations. He had also complicated severe hepatic dysfunction due to the cardiac constriction and the secondary tricuspid valve regurgitation. With the aid of cardiopulmonary bypass radical pericardiectomy was performed for almost all cardiac surfaces including that of both ventricles, the right atrium, and the venae cavae. After the pericardiectomy, aortic valvular replacement, mitral and tricuspid valvular annuloplasties were performed.

Twenty-two patients (17 males, 5 females) with spontaneous bacteremia (n = 7) or bacterial peritonitis (n = 15) were treated with oral pefloxacin 400 mg per 24 hr alone (n = 1) or in combination with another oral antibiotic, trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole (n = 13), amoxicillin (n = 6), cefadroxil (n = 2), or metronidazole (n = 1). In patients with spontaneous bacteremia, all organisms were found to be sensitive to oral antibiotics, and a favorable response was elicited in 6 out of 7 (86 p. cent) within 3 days (mean) of treatment. In patients with spontaneous peritonitis, ascitic fluid cultures were positive in 11 cases, and organisms were sensitive to pefloxacin in 9 out of 11 cases. A favorable response was elicited in 13 out of 15 within 2 to 8 days of treatment. Fourteen patients died (64 p. cent), 3 of infection (bacteremia n = 1, peritonitis n = 2), and 11 patients of causes unrelated to infection, mainly variceal hemorrhage, hepatorenal syndrome or hepatocellular carcinoma, although the clinical symptoms of infection were controlled. One-year survival was 57 p. cent in patients with bacteremia and 33 p. cent in those with bacterial peritonitis. Oral treatment was well tolerated in all patients. We suggest that most bacteremia and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in cirrhotic patients can be treated with oral antibiotics.

Our purpose was to determine whether or not patients with a low risk of relapse can be identified at the time of the initial staging evaluation. In 30 of 82 patients (Group 1), embryonal carcinoma constituted less than 80 percent of the tumor, no vessel invasion was present, and the preorchiectomy serum AFP level was less than 80 ng/dL. No relapses occurred in this group. Fifty-two patients (Group 2) had more than 80 percent embryonal carcinoma or vessel invasion or a serum AFP level higher than 80 ng/dL. Relapse occurred in 24 (46%) of these patients. The difference in the rate of relapse between patients in Group 1 and Group 2 was statistically significant (P less than 0.00001). A separate analysis of teratoma as a predictor of nonrelapse showed that the orchiectomy specimens of 30 of the 82 patients contained more than 50 percent teratoma. Only 1 relapse occurred among 25 patients with more than 50 percent teratoma and no vessel invasion.

The decision to proceed with orthotopic liver transplantation was made on the basis of progressive clinical deterioration despite aggressive support and because of her small liver size. After transplant, the patient's multisystem failure rapidly reversed. Histopathological examination of the native liver demonstrated predominantly zone 3 microvesicular steatosis with characteristic ultrastructural changes consistent with acute fatty liver of pregnancy. Southern blot analysis for Epstein-Barr virus DNA was negative. We conclude that orthotopic liver transplantation should be considered for the small group of patients with fulminant hepatic failure associated with acute fatty liver of pregnancy who manifest signs of irreversible liver failure despite delivery of the fetus and aggresive supportive care.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"fulminant hepatic failure\", \"Symptoms\": [\"fever\", \"vomiting\", \"diarrhea\", \"malaise\"], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"orthotopic liver transplantation\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [\"serum laboratory findings,quantitative computed tomography\"], \"Causes\": \"acute fatty liver of pregnancy\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

Dose values from literature were used for calculation of total effective dose equivalent.

Before closing, Cisplatin 100 mg and Etoposide 200 mg were instilled into the intraperitoneal cavity. Two courses of systemic chemotherapy with PAC (Cisplatin 50 mg, Pirarubicin 40 mg, Cyclophosphamide 400 mg) were instituted. To examine shrinkage of the hepatic metastasis and the peritoneal tumors, A \"Second look\" operation was conducted. Abdominal simple total hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, omentectomy and partial sigmoidectomy resulted in no residual lesions in the peritoneal cavity with the exception of the hepatic metastatic lesion (69 x 57 mm). Two additional courses of PAC therapy were administered after the \"Second look\" operation. The hepatic metastatic lesion shrank to 45 x 41 mm; a decrease of 83.8% compared to the pre-therapy in size.

We describe an uncommon variant of acute pancreatitis in which signs of inflammation persist over a number of months, waxing and waning but never disappearing. Neither identifiable collections nor other targets for surgical drainage develop in these patients, nor does their condition ever remit enough to allow them to leave the hospital. Eating provokes a flareup of inflammation. We have treated five such patients with a pancreatoduodenectomy (four patients) or total pancreatectomy (one patient). Each patient had been continuously hospitalized for six to 12 weeks before operation. All survived the operation and left the hospital eating solid food within 16 days. In addition to acute inflammation and fat necrosis, the resected specimens showed main pancreatic duct stenosis or occlusion in three patients, a pancreaticoduodenal fistula in one, and a congenital duplication cyst. Pancreatography or cholangiography showed the lesion in three of four cases and helped in planning therapy. Thus, acute pancreatitis may fall to remit because of proximal pancreatic duct obstruction, for which pancreatoduodenectomy is a reasonable and effective treatment.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"acute pancreatitis\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"pancreatoduodenectomy\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

Of the 51 patients having total cystectomy, 22 were operated upon after other treatments had failed. There were six (11.8%) operative deaths, only one following simple cystectomy, and the remainder following radical cystectomy with or without urethrectomy. Almost half the survivors died in the first two years, and the five-year survival was 31%. The better prognosis in total cystectomy is attributable to the presence of a number of patients with multicentric but relatively non-invasive tumours. Thirteen patients, all with invasive bladder tumours, had 4,000 R irradiation to the pelvis before operation. There was no benefit demonstrated in this combined treatment. The loss survival rate despite treatment in deeply invasive bladder tumours indicates the value of early diagnosis and the need for more effective forms of treatment.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"bladder cancer\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"partial cystectomy\", \"CureRate\": \"0.11\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}, {\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"total cystectomy\", \"CureRate\": \"0.31\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

Synovial sarcoma of the endolarynx is extremely rare, only one previously reported case appearing in English literature. Contrary to earlier beliefs, this tumor does not arise from the synovial lining of joints and bursa but develops from pleuripotential mesenchymal cells through abnormal differentiation into synovial neoplasms. Microscopically the tumor is characterized by a biphasic pattern of pseudoepithelial cells and a spindle cell element with fibrosarcomatous appearance. One additional case of synovial sarcoma of the endolarynx is reported. The tumor arose from the right subglottic area and presented submucosally. It was treated by extended frontolateral partial vertical (hemi) laryngectomy. The patient is alive and well 3 years after surgery. This case is the first reported to be successfully treated by partial laryngeal surgery alone. The histopathology of synovial sarcoma is reviewed and details of the biopsy and surgical technique are presented. This single case might suggest that early synovial sarcoma of the larynx is locally nonaggressive.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"synovial sarcoma of the larynx\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"partial laryngectomy\", \"CureRate\": \"1.0\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [\"biopsy\"], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

Three cases of familial polyposis and Gardner's syndrome were treated by either total colectomy and rectal mucosectomy (2 cases) or a partial Reifferscheid procedure (1 case).

She had no personal or family history of stigmas of tuberous sclerosis. On physical examination, a movable hard smooth mass of fist size was palpable in the right abdomen. Drip infusion pyelography revealed an elevation of right kidney. Ultrasonography revealed that the abdominal mass had a high amplitude echo area. On CT the mass was heterogeneous with irregular margin and had regions of low attenuation value, suspicious of a tumor with high fat content. An angiogram of the right renal artery revealed a hypervascular tumor showing multiple saccular aneurysms, and absence of arteriovenous shunting. Based on the aforementioned findings, the mass was diagnosed as renal angiomyolipoma. Partial right nephrectomy was performed through an extraperitoneal approach.

Selection of the patients was based solely on arteriographic criteria. Arteriography after dilatation showed considerable widening of the stenosed area in all patients. In 65 patients the effect of treatment on the blood pressure was assessed during follow up periods of one to four years. In 14 of these patients the hypertension was cured, in 29 it was improved, and in 22 there was no change. Patients with fibromuscular lesions benefited distinctly more than did those with atheromatous stenosis, only one of the 21 patients with fibromuscular lesions showing no change as compared with 21 of the 44 patients with atheromatous lesions. The only serious complication encountered was microcholesterol emboli, which developed in two patients with severe atheromatous lesions of the aorta. In the atheromatous group age and overall renal function had no influence on the blood pressure response. In the subgroup of patients with a unilateral lesion the renal vein renin ratios and asymmetrical curves obtained by renography had only a very limited predictive value. In experienced hands percutaneous transluminal arterial dilatation is relatively safe, and this study suggests that it should be attempted in all patients with renal artery stenosis. Only in patients with severe atheromatosis of the aorta should the risk associated with the catheterisation be weighed against the 50% or so chance of benefit from the procedure.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"renal artery stenosis\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"percutaneous transluminal arterial dilatation\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [\"arteriography\"], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

A 42-year-old man was admitted for a heart murmur and abnormal findings in the screening chest roentgenogram. Having no symptoms on admission, his physical activity was evaluated as Class I according to the classification of the New York Heart Association. A systolic murmur (Levine III/VI) with split second sound was audible at the left sternal border in the 3rd intercostal space. Chest roentgenogram revealed 57% of the cardio-thoracic ratio and no signs of increased pulmonary vascular markings. ECG showed incomplete right bundle branch block. Echocardiography and right ventriculography visualized the supravalvular membranous structured stenosed pulmonary artery 1cm above the pulmonic valve. Systolic pressure gradient between the right ventricle and the distal main pulmonary trunk was 54mmHg. The patient was diagnosed as having pulmonary supravalvular membranous stenosis. PTBD was applied using Inoue balloon catheter, where inflation was initiated from approximately 120% of pulmonary arterial diameter and terminated at 150%. This procedure decreased systolic pressure gradient from 54mmHg to 36mmHg without complication. After PTBD right ventriculography demonstrated that a part of the membranous structure had become floppy and movable. Pulmonary arterial diameter was unchanged. We considered that PTBD tore the membranous structure, which consequently resulted in the decrease of systolic pressure gradient. Systolic murmur diminished to Levine II/VI. Six months later, cardiac catheterization showed no change in systolic pressure gradient compared with that immediately after PTBD. This is the first report on pulmonary supravalvular membranous stenosis successfully treated with PTBD.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"pulmonary supravalvular membranous stenosis\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"percutaneous transluminal balloon dilatation\", \"CureRate\": \"1.0\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [\"chest roentgenogram,Echocardiography,right ventriculography\"], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

The main factor distinguishing survivors was the frequency of sepsis (none of 13 survivors vs 17 of 31 nonsurvivors). Preexisting malignancy and total number of acute insults to renal function were significantly less frequent, and immediate clinical and biochemical outcome of dialysis significantly better in survivors. The overall complication rate of dialysis was high (31 of 44 patients), but was significantly lower in survivors.

Therefore, valves of 24 CAPD patients (ages 55 +/- 11 years; CAPD duration: 29 +/- 28 months) were studied in a prospective echocardiographic and Doppler echocardiographic follow-up analysis over 35 months.

Eight patients benefited from this treatment.

After delivery she continued to have active TTP with thrombocytopenia which responded repeatedly to plasma infusion though their frequency gradually decreased to about one unit every 3-4 weeks. Three years after the birth of the first child she conceived again and was easily managed with repeated plasma infusions although the frequency and amount of plasma required to prevent thrombocytopenia were increased. She delivered a normal 3.4 kg term baby after which she again had a decreased plasma requirement. This is the first report of a woman with 5 years of active TTP managed with plasma alone. She experienced two pregnancies in which both mother and infant survived. We believe that the use of plasma in the management of TTP during pregnancy will improve the survival rate of both mother and infant.

Before CMA administration, both cases showed normal chemosensitivity of hypoxic and hypercapnic ventilatory responses (HVR and HCVR) at daytime, although marked oxygen desaturation with sleep apnea was observed. During CMA administration for 7 days, HVR, HCVR and occlusion pressure response to flow-resistive loading were altogether augmented. In one case obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) was altered to obstructive hypopnea, and in the other case central apnea disappeared completely, resulting in remarkable improvement of oxygen desaturation at sleep and daytime somnolence in both cases.

All had been treated by an extremely rigorous conservative regime in which the patients were kept in hospital for an average period of twenty-six months, during which time they were confined to bed with the legs in wide abduction, first in traction and later in \"broomstick\" plasters to ensure \"containment\" of the femoral head. The patients were assessed by the joint clincial and radiological method described by Ratliff (1956). The results were very satisfactory, with only 2 per cent poor results and 10 per cent fair. The remaining 88 per cent were good. The radiological results at the end of treatment have also been compared with control series described by Catterall (1972) and with the osteotomy series of Lloyd-Roberts, Catterall and Salamon (1976). From this it appears that the described regime offers no benefit compared with the natural history in Catterall's Groups I and II, and in Group III the results were only marginally better than those following osteotomy. In Group IV cases, however, where the femoral head was totally involved, the benefit was important, and since these are the cases which carry the worst natural prognosis it is suggested that the use of the method described in such instances must be seriously considered in spite of its social disadvantages. The theoretical implications of the findings are considered, and it is concluded that the benefits of the method cannot be ascribed wholly to the application of the \"containment\" principle.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"perthes' disease\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"prolonged recumbency and femoral head containment\", \"CureRate\": \"0.88\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

Langerhans' cell (LC) and T-cell were stained immunohistochemically on the specimens excised from the cervical cancer. In squamous cell carcinoma, 5-year survival rates for patients with LC infiltration were significantly better than those without LC (78% versus 60%; P &lt; 0.01). The 5-year survival rate of patients with T-cell infiltration also was significantly better than that of patients without such infiltration (83% versus 61%; P &lt; 0.05). Similar trends were observed in patients with adenocarcinoma; 5-year survival rates for patients with LC infiltration and those without LC infiltration were 49% and 25%, respectively (P &lt; 0.025). The survival rates for patients with T-cell infiltration and those without were 50% and 33%, respectively (P &lt; 0.1). An analysis of patterns of failure of radiation therapy demonstrated that the favorable prognosis in LC infiltration was attributable mainly to improvement of local control rates, but that in T-cell infiltration was not. T-cells infiltrated into tumor specifically in the patients with LC infiltration in both cell types. The authors suggest that the host anti-cancer immune response of individual patients may be remarkably different at the first step of antigen recognition by LC. The LC may induce T-cell-mediated antitumor response and improve local response in radiation therapy.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"cervical cancer\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"radiation therapy\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

Survival did not exceed 2 years in any patient, and the reasons for these poor results are investigated. These included the particular selection of patients, the choice of radiotherapy as basic treatment, and the dosage administered. A new therapeutic approach is proposed based on pathologic findings and the various therapeutic measures available. Preoperative chemotherapy is followed by a total laryngopharyngectomy, with a total esophagectomy without opening the thorax and under certain well defined conditions. Continuity is re-established by a gastropharyngostomy, and postoperative radiotherapy is given routinely.

This report is confined to the 165 patients treated by radiation therapy (RT) only and focuses on the problem of relapse in the neck. A comparison is made between patients treated for the primary tumor with RT portals less than or equal to 30 cm2 and patients treated with larger field sizes. Sixty patients suffered a local recurrence, which was followed by a relapse in the neck in 13 patients. Nineteen patients experienced a relapse in the neck without a previous local failure. Five of these patients experienced a local failure at a later time. A multivariate analysis showed that the risk of a regional failure was significantly higher after a local failure and also for patients treated with small radiation portals (less than or equal to 30 cm2). Patients with an advanced tumor stage did not have a higher risk of a regional failure. A recurrence in the neck carried a poor survival; nearly two thirds of these patients died of their disease.

We used flow cytometry in 30 patients with transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder who received pre-operative irradiation (40 Gy in 24 patients, 20 Gy in 5 patients and 60 Gy in one) with follow-up for at least 3 years. Total 140 paraffin embedded samples (4.6 samples per one patient) were available.

Eight DNA diploid tumors and twenty-two DNA aneuploid ones were detected before irradiation. Although diploid group didn't change its DNA ploidy after irradiation, of 22 aneuploid tumors 18 were changed to DNA diploid and 4 were not changed in their ploidy. 2. The tumor eradicating effect of irradiation was shown to be higher (p &lt; 0.05) in the diploid group (5 of 8, 63%) than in the aneuploid group (5 of 22, 23%). 3.

Evidence for favorable survival in patients with DNA diploid tumors.\nAbstract: Stage D1 disease is found in at least every sixth patient undergoing bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy and radical retropubic prostatectomy (RRP) for clinically localized prostate cancer (PC). Previous recommendations for monotherapy using surgery, radiation, or systemic therapy alone for Stage D1 disease have usually been associated with a poor outcome in regard to progression and survival. Unlike other pathologic stages, D1 disease treated with RRP is mainly related to DNA ploidy pattern in regard to all end points (progression and survival) and immediate adjuvant hormonal treatment (AHT) rather than to the usual pathologic variables, including the number of positive nodes. Complete DNA ploidy information was available in 370 patients with Stage D1 disease (age range, 40-77 years; mean, 64 years) undergoing RRP with or without AHT with a follow-up of up to 22 years (mean, 5 years). Overall, 80% of all DNA ploidy classes (diploid, 37%; tetraploid, 46%; and aneuploid, 17%) had AHT that highly significantly delayed progression for diploid (P less than 0.0001) more than tetraploid (P less than 0.0001) and more than aneuploid (P less than 0.0001) tumors. Significant prolongation of the disease-free interval might have improved the quality of life for tetraploid and aneuploid patients. Survival (crude and cause-specific) was significantly (P = 0.02) improved only for diploid patients who received AHT but not for tetraploid and aneuploid patients. This was due to the significantly accelerated death rate after progression in those patients with early AHT for tetraploid and aneuploid (but not diploid) tumors. Delayed (on progression only) AHT resulted in high progression rates for all DNA ploidy classes (aneuploid greater than tetraploid greater than diploid); e.g., 21 of 30 diploid patients progressed and 6 patients died from disease at a median of 31.5 months in spite of immediate hormone treatment on progression. RRP and AHT for patients with Stage D1 disease resulted in a highly significant delay in overall progression (76% at 10 years) and excellent local control, depending on DNA ploidy pattern (diploid greater than tetraploid greater than aneuploid) compared with a treatment regimen without AHT (24% overall nonprogression); only 20% of all patients with AHT are projected to die of disease at 10 years. Disease in diploid patients (37%) treated with AHT rarely progressed and those patients are unlikely to die of disease in 10 years or less; delayed (on progression) hormone treatment for diploid patients seemed ineffective. Inclusion of values for prostate specific antigen led to a higher failure rate on progression, and this is dependent on DNA ploidy class (diploid greater than tetraploid greater than aneuploid). Only patients with nondiploid tumors should be entered into prospective studies using innovative adjuvant treatment protocols to improve survival.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"prostate cancer\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"radical prostatectomy and adjuvant hormonal treatment\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

Fifty-two percent of patients who were followed for 5 years were free of recurrence after a single RC procedure. Factors predicting clinical results were sought from initial historical and demographic data. Age, sex, duration of illness, and previous response to medication were unrelated to outcome. Patients previously treated by open surgery appeared to receive less benefit from subsequent RC. The RC procedure seemed more effective in the treatment of patients with classical tic douloureux than in those with atypical features. The degree of sensory loss created by RC was associated with the clinical outcome. Patients acquiring dense sensory deficits demonstrated a reduced risk of recurrence (p = 0.006): 25% of patients with dense sensory loss and 55% of those with a partial deficit developed a recurrence by 5 years, whereas all patients without initial sensory loss suffered a recurrence by 5 years.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"trigeminal neuralgia\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"radiofrequency coagulation\", \"CureRate\": \"0.52\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

Following 40 Gy irradiation of the lower abdomen, treatment consisted of cystectomy or continued irradiation of the bladder region only. A full urological examination of the bladder established whether a patient was a responder or non-responder. The patients were divided into four groups: 27 responders treated with cystectomy and diversion; 48 responders treated with continued radiotherapy up to 65 Gy; 24 non-responders treated with cystectomy and diversion; 42 non-responders treated with continued radiotherapy up to 65 Gy. Survival and complications of treatment were compared with regard to category and grade of the tumours and sex and age of the patients. It was concluded that the responders who underwent cystectomy after 40 Gy irradiation survived longer than those who received a full course of radiotherapy. The responders had a better survival rate than non-responders, regardless of further treatment. Salvage cystectomy was rarely carried out and proved to be an unsatisfactory alternative, with a high operative risk and short survival.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"bladder cancer\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"radiotherapy\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

High doses, close to the maximum tolerable, were used with the shrinking field technique with no attempt at prophylactic whole neck irradiation. T1 and T2 cases represented 40% of the whole group and 40% of the patients presented clinically positive neck disease. This latter group had a significantly lower cure rate (42.8%) than the N0 patients (88.3%). Disease control depended also on the T stage: all 30 T1 and T2 lesions, 18/22 (81.8%) of the T3, and 6/17 (35.3%) of the T4 lesions were controlled. Cord fixation and early cartilage destruction were not a major obstacle for tumor control. Base of tongue involvement and especially the T4 and N3 association were indications of poor prognosis. Adenopathies smaller than 3 cm were controlled in 14/16 cases while nodes greater than or equal to 3 cm were controlled in 5/11 cases. Failures in neck nodes outside the treatment field were encountered in 7% of the cases but as the sole element of failure they represented 5.6%. Absolute survival at 3 years was 69.7% for the whole series while loco-regional control was 74.6%. No patient was salvaged by surgery. Three loco-regional recurrences occurred 3 years after the treatment. Although no lethal complications were encountered severe late reactions were noted in about 20% of the patients with controlled primary lesion, requiring tracheostomy in 4 cases (7%). Treatment guidelines are suggested: T1, T2, &amp; T3 lesions associated with adenopathy smaller than 3 cm should be treated by radiotherapy. Limited extra laryngeal extension especially to cartilage can still be controlled by irradiation. More advanced cases, especially the subcategory of T4 N3 patients, should have a multidisciplinary approach.

The actuarial survival rate and relapse-free survival rate of all patients after 5 years were 55.0 and 51.3%, respectively. Twenty-one patients with stage I disease had a significantly better survival rate than did 12 patients with stage II disease (P less than 0.01). Without combination chemotherapy, all 15 patients with stage I NH treated by radiation therapy were in complete remission, and 14 of them remained alive and well. Among these 15 patients, no difference in relapse was observed between patients who received involved field irradiation (1 of 6) and those who received extended field irradiation (2 of 9). Patients with stage II or more NH should be treated with intensive chemotherapy and radiotherapy, as are patients with diffuse histiocytic lymphoma (DH). However, involved field radiotherapy with careful follow-up observation may be the treatment of choice for patients with stage I NH, provided their tumors are not bulky.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"nodular histiocytic lymphoma\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"radiotherapy\", \"CureRate\": \"0.51\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

The present prospective study was to determine the influence of previous radiotherapy, widely used in the management of this tumour, on the accuracy of endosonography. A complete endosonographic examination was performed just before surgery in 40 patients with rectal cancer. Endosonographic and pathological staging were compared in group A, 21 patients without previous radiotherapy, and group B, 19 patients with preoperative radiotherapy. While the endosonographic accuracy for lymph node involvement was similar in the two groups (85 per cent compared with 84 per cent), wall invasion was correctly ascertained in 86 per cent in group A but in only 47 per cent in group B (P less than 0.05). After irradiation, the thickening of the rectal wall and the poor visualization of the hyperechoic layers hampered interpretation. Post-radiotherapy inflammation and/or fibrosis probably explained the echographic changes. Radiotherapy therefore altered endosonographic staging of rectal cancer.

About 1/2 had undifferentiated squamous epithelioma and the others moderately differentiated epthelioma. Radiotherapy consisted of intracavity radium of 5000 mg-hr. and an external telecobalt irradiation up to 4000 rad tumor dose through 4 portals. During and after radiotherapy patients were followed by clinical examiniations and vaginal smears. Months after beginning of treatment another cervical punch biopsy was done. The 3 year recovery rate was 97% of stage 1 but only 75% of stage 2 patients. Recovery seemed better in well differentiated epithelioma and in cases treated first with external radiation. There were 13 deaths from recurrent disease within 5 to 35 months after begining of treatment. Punch biopsies performed 4 months after beginning of treatment revealed carcinomatous tissue in the cervical area of only 2 of these 13 patients.

All eight patients demonstrated a continuous rise in the absolute number of neutrophils, eosinophils, and monocytes over the first four weeks of therapy. Bone marrow examination revealed a progressive increase in bone marrow cellularity in all patients except one. An increase in myeloid: erythroid ratio was seen with progressive maturation of granulocytic cells. Neutrophilic and eosinophilic myelocytes were the most prominent cells. The percentage of myeloblasts and promyelocytes did not increase significantly, and the proportions of postmitotic granulocytic cells did not change either. No significant morphologic changes were noted in the basophilic, erythroid, and megakaryocytic series. The most prominent topographic observation in the bone marrow during GM-CSF therapy was the frequent clustering of myeloid cells close to the bone trabeculae. The periosteal localization of myeloid precursors may reflect a higher concentration of stem cells and/or stromal cells in the bone marrow adjacent to the bone trabeculae or a higher concentration of growth factors.

Experience with treatment of biliary fistulas when there is a residual cystic cavity, provides arguments for and against primary suture of these fistulas.

In fact, while the air released by the alveolar baro-trauma can, once a given pressure is exceeded, migrate into the retroperitoneum and produce a non-surgical pneumascos (for which the other possible causes are far more exceptional, and rather are unpleasant surprises, such as this orogenital induced PPT in Gantt's female patient, conversely the pressurized air from true ruptures of intraabdominal hollow organs may migrate into the mediastinum and cause a thoracic air leakage syndrome that perfectly simulates this pulmonary baro-trauma. Therefore all the paraclinical means required must be used to confirm--or rule out--this diagnosis of perforation, which demands emergency surgery.

Under conditions of a conventional diabetes diet (including 5-6 meals per day and a strictly planned meal intake) as well as under a \"less restricted diabetes diet\" (e.g., free choice of number, timing, and amount of carbohydrate intake) near normoglycemia could be achieved. Mean daily blood glucose levels did not change significantly when the patients' nutrition was alternated between both diets. During the \"less restricted diabetes diet,\" the patients opted for a rather high fat intake (51 +/- 5% fat, 34 +/- 5% carbohydrate, and 15 +/- 2% protein). Despite this unintended dietary behavior, serum lipids and body weight remained normal after an observation period of 4-6 mo. It is concluded that during permanent near normoglycemia achieved by CSII a partial liberalization of the diabetes diet does not introduce any short-term or long-term metabolic risk factors for cardiovascular diseases.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"type i diabetes\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

Mean plasma glucose levels were near-normal during the 24 h and, in particular, constant throughout the night. In a subset of six patients overnight plasma free insulin concentrations were also constant during CSII. The majority of profiles (88%) showed a glucose nadir from 2.0 to 5.9 mmol/L (most frequently at 0600 h) and had an 0800 h value from 2.0 to 6.9 mmol/L (92%). A large proportion (46%) of profiles showed a zero or negative nadir-0800 h glycemic increase. In 22 patients with three or more profiles recorded at the same basal insulin infusion rate, only one of 103 profiles had a fasting glycemic increase greater than an arbitrary value of 5.0 mmol/L (5.3), although many patients exhibited small dawn glycemic increases (e.g., 14 of 22 had a mean increase of from 0 to 2 mmol/L). In 12 subjects a 15% reduction in basal insulin infusion rate increased the mean +/- SEM dawn glycemic increase from 0.58 +/- 0.25 mmol/L to 2.7 +/- 0.76 mmol/L (P less than 0.025) as well as significantly increasing the nocturnal nadir and 0800 h plasma glucose concentrations. Thus, a marked dawn phenomenon is rare when a single but adequate basal infusion rate is used for CSII, and this questions the need in the majority of patients for preprogrammable pumps with nocturnal infusion rate changes.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"diabetes\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

The average ejection fraction was 29 +/- 4%, range 17 to 35%. Thirteen patients had ventricular aneurysms, 4 had grade 3 or 4 mitral regurgitation. The coronary lesions were usually multivessel left main coronary (6), triple vessel disease (27), double vessel disease (12), single vessel disease (1). The average number of bypass grafts per patient was 2.3. The average aorting clamping time was 63 minutes (range 26 to 133 minutes). There were 4 mitral valve replacements, 4 resections of ventricular aneurysms and 1 double procedure (aneurysmectomy and valve replacement). The operative mortality was 2.1% (1 death).

They are aged from 45 to 79 years old, the average 56, and aspirated 1 to 24 days after the onset, two third of them being within 1 week. The whole procedure was done in the CT room under direct CT guidance and by one trial. In putaminal type hemorrhage, the removed hematoma volumes ranged from 9 to 48 ml, average being 23.7 ml, in thalamic type from 5 to 29 ml, average being 15.5 ml. The average rate of removal was 81.1% in 30 cases within 1 week. In most cases, preoperative consciousness was not severely disturbed, in putaminal type, 19 were alert or confused, 4 somnolent, 5 stuperous and in thalamic type, 6, 6, 3 respectively and 2 were semicomatous, one of them had herniation sign. In putaminal type all but 2 cases recovered to alert or confused state, the first one had postoperative bleeding and the other was already apallic preoperatively. In thalamic type, we lost 3 cases, 2 by gastrointestinal bleeding and 1 DIC, by rehemorrhage 2 months after the operation. All but one who was semicomatous preoperatively recovered to alertness. In motor function, some cases of the putaminal bleeding with intact internal capsule remained hemiplegic. On the other hand, most of the cases with partial destruction of the internal capsule on CT recovered well in both types of hematoma.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"hypertensive intracerebral hematoma\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"CT guided stereotactic aspiration\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

During cue-exposure sessions the relationship between CS (stimuli associated with binge-eating behaviour) and UCS (the sensations related to the intake of binge food) was broken. As predicted, the patients' craving for food declined within as well as between cue exposure sessions and a radical decrease in the frequency of binge-eating persisted for at least nine months.

A controlled clinical trial.\nAbstract: 100 patients with acute cholecystitis (AC) diagnosed by clinical, laboratory, and roentgenological examinations were randomly divided into 2 groups; early surgery (ES), operated within 7 days after the onset of acute symptoms, and delayed (DS), operated 2--3 months after the acute episode. Patients with elevated serum bilirubin and/or amylase were included in the trial. Two patients died during conservative treatment, and in 4 cases medical treatment was interrupted because of peritonitis, and in 3 cases because of increasing jaundice. Recurrence of AC was found in 24% of the patients in the DS group. There was no mortality in the ES group, but 2 patients died postoperatively in the DS group. Wound infection developed in 3 patients in the ES, and in 8 patients in the DS group. Retained stones remained in 3 cases of the DS and in 1 case of the ES group. The operative procedures were easier to perform in the ES group than in the DS, as estimated by the duration of operation. The operation time was 76.7 +/- 4.6 min (mean p S.E.) in the ES and 98.0 +/- 7.3 min in the DS group. There was a statistically significant difference between the 2 groups (p less than 0.01).

On admission to our clinic she was neurologically free except the pulsating mass (2 X 3 cm) with bruit and thrill. Selective right external carotid angiography revealed a high-flow simple AVF from internal maxillary artery to jugular vein. The normal blood flow of both the external and internal carotid system was decreased. Under local anesthesia, non-detachable balloon catheter was inserted to the internal maxillary artery by the transfemoral approach and inflated at the proximal side of the orifice of AVF until the vascular murmur in the neck disappeared. The balloon catheter was then exchanged with a detachable balloon catheter (Debrun, No. 9) which was inflated by silicone (0.4 ml), and was detached successfully.

Annual incidence of end stage renal failure (ESRF) treated by dialysis increased of 25% when two consecutive periods of five years each were compared: A (1976-1980) 46 per 10(6) inhabitants, B (1981-1985) 62 per 10(6) inhabitants. In 1986, the progression was confirmed: 96 per 10(6). At the time of the beginning of dialysis treatment, mean age (+/- SD) was not different between two periods: 53 +/- 17 yrs (A) vs 51 +/- 17 yrs (B) but it increased in 1986: 61 +/- 14 yrs. Sex ratio (M/F) progressed from 1 (A) to 1.75 (B). The study of causes of ESRF showed a net increase of secondary renal diseases (diabetes, amyloidosis), interstitial nephropathies due to obstructive uropathy (lithiasis) and drugs.

A 59-year-old man was admitted because of sudden deep coma and tetraparesis. Neurological examination on admission showed miotic pupils with absent light reaction, no oculocephalic reflex, no corneal reflex and tetraparesis. Glasgow scale was evaluated to be E-1 V-1, and M-3 with total of 5 points. Computed tomography confirmed a large hematoma in the cerebellum with ventricular rupture. Immediately, a suboccipital craniectomy was performed and the hematoma was evacuated. His neurological condition was improved gradually within a month after the operation. He responded to verbal orders and moved all his limbs against gravity. His respiration, however, was irregular with a pattern of so-called \"cluster breathing\" followed by prolonged apnea, that was more pronounced in night. He was suffered from hypoxic hypercapnea and recurrent pneumonia. Therefore, authors decided to employ diaphragm pacing for management of central alveolar hypoventilation. A diaphragm pacemaker (radiofrequency induction) was implanted. A cuff electrode was put around the right phrenic nerve in the right thorax, and the receiver installed subcutaneously in the right anterior chest. Postoperative respiratory study showed ventilation on pacing with satisfactory blood gas and he became able to move around using a wheel chair.

The results confirm the hypolipidaemic activity of bezafibrate, changes in the levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, lipids and lipoproteins (LDL, VLDL and HDL) being similar in direction and magnitude to those reported previously. A significant regression in the size of the Achilles tendon xanthomas was observed in 11 of the 13 patients, and the regression in the Achilles tendon index correlated significantly with a favourable change in the ratio HDL/LDL + VLDL.

The average mean percentage change ranged from -58 to +133% compared with untreated samples. The apolipoprotein method selected was validated by comparing their concentrations with their corresponding lipoprotein lipid or protein in normal controls and Type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) diabetic patients. The coefficient of variation was maintained below 3.5% for apo AI, AII, B and HDL2-apo AI.

To investigate the effects of different treatment modalities, the composition and concentrations of fasting plasma lipoproteins were determined in a cross-sectional study of patients with type II diabetes at diagnosis, treated by diet alone, treated by diet + glibenclamide (2.5 to 15 mg/d for 6 to 48 months), and treated by diet + insulin (25 to 65 U/d for 8 to 144 months). Compared with normal subjects matched for sex, age, body mass index, exercise, alcohol consumption and smoking, type II patients at diagnosis showed increased concentrations of nonesterified and esterified cholesterol, triglyceride, phospholipid, and protein in the very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) fraction. However, the only alteration in VLDL composition was a small decrease in the relative proportion of phospholipid. Apolipoprotein-B and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentrations were also raised in type II patients at diagnosis. Plasma concentrations of high density lipoprotein (HDL) nonesterified and esterified cholesterol, phospholipid, and apo-AI were lower in type II patients at diagnosis. This was largely accounted for by reduced concentrations of these components in the HDL2 subfraction, which retained a normal composition. Type II patients treated by diet alone and diet + glibenclamide exhibited similar abnormalities of plasma lipoprotein concentrations, which are associated with premature coronary disease, to the type II patients at diagnosis. However, in type II patients treated with insulin, plasma lipoprotein concentrations and composition were normal, except LDL cholesterol, which was lower than normal in insulin-treated patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"non-insulin-dependent diabetes\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"diet, sulphonylurea, and insulin\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

But it has not been well described that the anticholinergic drug causes chronic dementia after long administration. We describe six cases of chronic dementia, which is thought to be induced by anticholinergic drug. We conducted detailed neuropsychological and neuroradiological examination in these six cases. All of them were Parkinson's disease, and had used anticholinergic drug for more than six months without any side effect, and then their initial symptom of dementia appeared, followed by chronic dementia. All cases recovered reversibly from dementia within a few weeks after stoppage of taking anticholinergic drug. And any of our cases had no possibility in the cause of chronic dementia other than the side effect of anticholinergic drug. Detailed neuropsychological examinations (WAIS, WMSR, and so on) were conducted in all cases, SPECT was in two cases, and PET was in one case, before and after stoppage of the anticholinergic drug. And in all cases, brain MRI was conducted. The indices of attention, verbal memory, visual memory, and delayed recall were significantly elevated after stoppage of drug. And both verbal IQ and performance IQ were increased after stoppage of drug, too.

The total mortality rate in a series of 1,057 pediatric patients admitted to Shriners Burns Institute Galveston Unit between 1982 and 1986 was 2.7%. The burn size resulting in a 50% death rate was 95% of the total body surface area (TBSA). In this study 19 survivors and 13 nonsurvivors with greater than 70% full-thickness TBSA burn injuries were compared.

Forty-six per cent of the nonsurvivors sustained an inhalation injury; 31% were not initially adequately resuscitated.

The key to successful management lies in the early suspicion in patients with atrial fibrillation or recent myocardial infarction, presenting with sudden abdominal pain and an unremarkable physical examination. Abdominal angiography is strongly recommended; however, immediate laparatomy should not be postponed if angiography is not available. Early embolectomy is the only useful means of treatment to restore mesenteric circulation, preserve the bowel and rescue the patient. A 56-year-old woman was admitted with a 5-year history of rheumatic heart disease and atrial fibrillation. She had a sudden attack of severe abdominal pain 8 hours after cardiac catheterization. Abdominal examination was not remarkable and plain abdominal X-ray was negative, while bloody stools and leukocytosis developed 7 hours later. Superior mesenteric embolism was highly suspected and emergency laparotomy was performed. Successful embolectomy was carried out through the distal approach and the patient recovered completely without requiring small bowel resection.

On the day of admission he was in a preshock state, and his pulmonary artery pressure was very high at 90/30 mmHg. Pulmonary blood perfusion scintigraphy showed multiple defects of isotope uptake. Immediately after the scintigraphy, pulmonary embolectomy was performed while using extracorporeal circulation. The operation was successful and his physical activity was markedly improved. After the operation, anti-coagulant and anti-platelet therapies were continued, but recurrence of pulmonary emboli was detected by scintigraphy, and some thrombi were found by venography in deep veins of the lower parts of both legs.

However, it is only effective in some cases and at least 12 weeks is required before efficacy can be ascertained. In an attempt to achieve earlier assessment of response, changes in lymphocyte counts have been studied in patients receiving endocrine therapy. Absolute lymphocytes were not significantly changed by 6 weeks in any patients but there was a significant increase (P less than 0.05) in absolute T counts by 6 weeks in patients who achieved partial remission when compared with those whose disease continued to progress. Percentage T counts increased significantly from pretreatment values (P less than 0.002) in patients in whom disease progression was stopped by endocrine manipulation and this rise was maintained during clinical benefit. Fall in percentage T counts to pretreatment values predated objective evidence of recurrence by as much as 2 months. There was no increase in percentage T counts in patients in whom disease progression continued despite treatment, indicating that the rise in percentage T counts is a secondary phenomenon to tumour response.

Another patient died of acute pancreatitis. The patients were old. One quarter died before the follow-up, 1 to 5 years after the initial intervention. The results indicate that the combination of endoscopic sphincterotomy, insertion of an endoprosthesis, and, if feasible, stone extraction on a later occasion when the acute phase of the illness had subsided brought the disease sufficiently under control among three quarters of the patients with large common duct stones or stenoses in the biliary tract.

In order to avoid inappropriate selectivity and institutional bias, we studied only those cases submitted directly to the Registry of Ophthalmic Pathology in which the enucleated eyes had not been examined initially at the local hospital. Of the 56 eyes removed because of suspected retinoblastoma, 15 (26.8%) did not contain a malignant tumor. In two cases enucleation was delayed because retinoblastoma was not considered initially in the differential diagnosis of spontaneous hyphema. During the same period, two of 268 eyes that were enucleated for reasons other than suspected retinoblastoma were found to contain a retinoblastoma.

Light microscopic examination of bone tissue from 13 patients with Paget's bone disease who were receiving (EHDP) treatment showed considerably reduced osteoclastic resorption accompanied by gradual replacement of irregular woven bone by lamellar tissue. Electron microscopic examination confirmed that pagetoid osteoclasts are morphologically abnormal cells and degenerate after EHDP treatment.

The clinical features of these 4 cases were as severe as those recorded for fatal heat stroke patients, including shock over 10 hours in 4, coma longer than 120 hours in 3, ARDS and DIC in 1. From these findings, early exchange transfusion plus low dose heparin should be considered as one effective treatment in severe fatal heat stroke patients.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"heat stroke\", \"Symptoms\": [\"coma\", \"shock\"], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"exchange transfusion and heparin\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

At the age of 0.41 years vaginal bleeding was documented and signs of puberty were noted: PHIII, BII according to Tanner. The bone age was 1.3 years, and height velocity rose from the 50th to 90th percentile. Plasma concentrations of LH (5.85 mU/ml), FSH (3.29 mU/ml), growth hormone (30 ng/ml), and oestradiol (90 pg/ml) were elevated. The results of a neurological examination including an EEC recording as well as a skull roentgenogram, were unremarkable. The visual evoked potentials were grossly abnormal. A native and contrast CT scan visualized a tumour close to the suprasellar cisterna reaching the chiasma opticum. At the age of 1.2 years the tumours was removed. Histologically the tissue was identified as a hamartoma. Immediately after the operation vaginal bleeding ceased, pubertal development regressed, bone age did not advance any further, the visual evoked potentials normalized and the contrast CT did not show any tumour mass. The levels of LH, FSH, growth hormone and oestradiol 4 months post operation were decreased as follow: LH: 1.14 mU/ml, FSH: 0.70 mU/ml, GH: 15.1 ng/ml, oestradiol: 10 pg/ml.

In conclusion, the early diagnosis and operation is the key for successful treatment of poststernotomy mediastinitis. Wider debridement including sternum and ribs with perioperative lavage by diluted povidone-iodine solution and antibiotic solution should be done aggressively, and the transfer of the major pectoral muscle flap and skin closure without postoperative irrigation is an effective method of choice.

Experience with 50 cases treated by means of extensive laminectomy, foraminotomy, and excision of osteophytes during the past 10 years.\nAbstract: This paper reviews management by means of the posterior approach of 50 patients with cervical myeloradiculopathy caused by spondylosis and stenosis of the spinal canal seen in the past 10 years. Careful selection of patients is an absolute necessity since a primary cause of failure occurred in individuals who subsequently proved to have motor neurone disease. Older individuals with long-standing neurological deficits, especially long tract signs indicative of fixed lesions, were benefited primarily by a lack of further progression of their disorder and occasional improvement in hand function and gait. Diagnostic evaluation should include electromyography, nerve conduction studies, and sensory evoked cortical potentials. With the introduction of the fourth generation CAT scanning equipment, additional diagnostic information is available regarding the internal configuration of the spinal canal, its contents, and the amount of available space at various levels. Supplementary myelography remains of basic importance. Laminectomy includes two levels above and below the areas of significant canal encroachment. Foraminal decompression with removal of only the innermost third of the foramen permits mobilization of the nerve roots, removal of osteophytes and untethering of the dural sac. A great deal of importance is attached to the preservation of the cervical lordotic curve since, with an adequate decompression and an intact dura, the cord moves dorsally into an expanded canal, rising above the ventrally situated osteophytes. In those patients with reversal of the cervical curve and swan neck deformities, posterior decompression has not been of value. Recent more radical procedures in such cases, such as vertebrectomy, remain to be evaluated. Any procedure which will permit further kyphotic deformity, such as laminectomy, is contraindicated. Eighty-five percent of the patients operated upon by the recommended surgical approach improved.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"cervical spondylotic myeloradiculopathy\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"extensive laminectomy, foraminotomy, and excision of osteophytes\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [\"electromyography,nerve conduction studies,sensory evoked cortical potentials,CAT scanning,myelography\"], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

The breast and regional nodes received 45 Gy of 60Co irradiation in 25 fractions over 5 weeks (45 Gy/25/5 wks). Electrons were used to deliver a further 15 Gy/7/1.5 weeks to the internal mammary chain and 25 Gy/11/2.5 weeks to the lower axilla. The primary tumor was boosted by Iridium 192 implant for a further 37 Gy prescribed at 85% of the basal dose rate (Paris system). Rigid needles were secured by templates in single plane (58/398) or double plane (340/398) geometry. Results of the 340 two-plane implants have been analyzed to look for a possible influence of dose rate on local control. Follow-up for patients free of local recurrence is 4-204 months (median: 92 months). The 340 tumors were divided into three groups according to dose rate: 0.32-0.49 Gy/hr (n = 95), 0.50-0.59 Gy/hr (n = 120), and 0.60-0.90 Gy/hr (n = 125). The three groups are statistically comparable according to age, tumor size, mean 60Co dose, mean Iridium dose, overall treatment time, and follow-up. The local failure rate in the three groups is 27% (26/95), 20% (24/120), and 13% (16/125) (p less than 0.03, Chi square). At 15 years the estimated local control (Kaplan Meier) is 60%, 72%, and 84% (p less than 0.02, Logrank), respectively. This analysis indicates that there is a significant effect of dose rate on local control for carcinoma of the breast treated by combined external beam (45 Gy) plus Iridium 192 implantation (37 Gy). To maximize local control the authors recommend an implant dose rate of greater than or equal to 0.6 Gy/hr.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"breast cancer\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"external beam irradiation plus iridium 192 implant\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

Conventional external pituitary irradiation for acromegaly produces a consistent, but slow, fall in elevated serum growth hormone (GH) levels. It has not been established whether such treatment is effective in preventing the development of cardiovascular complications. The evolution of cardiovascular disease has therefore been studied in 11 acromegalic patients followed up for a mean 10 years (range 3-17) after external pituitary irradiation. At the final follow-up fasting serum GH were significantly (P less than 0.01) lower than pre-irradiation levels, but cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, dysrhythmias, hypertension, major arterial disease, heart failure) increased significantly in prevalence (P less than 0.01) during this period. Electrocardiographic abnormalities also increased in prevalence. At the final follow-up 6 patients had cardiomegaly on chest X-ray and echocardiographs (10 patients) were abnormal in every case. All 11 patients had evidence of complete or partial anterior hypopituitarism. We confirm that external pituitary irradiation is effective in reducing elevated serum GH levels in acromegaly, but suggest that such a slow reduction in serum GH levels does not retard the development of cardiovascular complications.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"acromegaly\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"external pituitary irradiation\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [\"electrocardiographic,chest X-ray,echocardiographs\"], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

In 64% of our patients a favourable tumour response to radiotherapy was seen, while a further 31% showed disease progression either during or on completion of radiotherapy. Cystectomy was performed on 22% of patients, mainly for radiation cystitis, and was not associated with a significant operative mortality rate. The crude 5-year survival rate was 42%.

Fifty-five knees had only an anterior laxity and 166 anterior laxity combined with medial laxity, in 100 of which tensioning or reinforcement of the medial ligament was needed. Forty-two per cent of sporting patients were able to return to sport at the same level, though half of them had some discomfort. Fifty-one per cent of patients did not experience any instability in daily and working life but half of them had occasional pain. Sixty-one per cent of knees did not, at review, show a positive MacIntosh pivot shift test and the absence of pivot shift correlated statistically with the quality of the functional result. In seventy-three per cent of knees there was a positive Lachmantest indicating definite laxity at the review. Thirty per cent of knees developed a lateral laxity, which questions the innocuousness of removal of the iliotibial tract. Twenty-seven per cent showed radiological deterioration of the medial joint space.

About two-thirds of the autotransplants were performed before percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) was established for clinical use. However, vascular disease at a site or type not suitable for PTA was present in 57 (90%) of the kidneys. Hypertension was the leading symptom in 56 patients, including four in whom renal autotransplantation was performed as an emergency for acute renal artery occlusion or malignant hypertension. Blood pressure returned to normal or improved in 51 (91%) and remained unchanged in five patients (9%) following autotransplantation. Three patients with renal artery aneurysm in whom haematuria and loin pain were the indications for treatment, became asymptomatic following surgical intervention. Bilateral renal autotransplantation was performed synchronously in one and sequentially in three patients. There were no operative deaths, but two kidneys were lost postoperatively in two 2-year-old children owing to renal vascular thrombosis. In the follow-up period (mean 4.3 years), one additional kidney was lost at 3 months owing to progressive FMD. Blood pressure and renal function remained stable in all other patients. Based on the excellent results achieved in this series, it is concluded that extracorporeal vascular repair and renal autotransplantation is a safe procedure for the patient as well as the kidney affected by FMD. The procedure is advocated as an alternative to in situ reconstruction in patients with renal artery disease not accessible to PTA, such as aneurysms and complex branch renal artery stenoses.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"fibro-muscular renal artery disease\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"extracorporeal vascular reconstruction and renal autotransplantation\", \"CureRate\": \"0.91\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

The patient posed a management problem because of the nephrotoxicity of the antibiotics required to control Candida. The literature was of little help in resolving the treatment dilemma because only 4 other cases of Candida pyarthrosis in adults, and only one other on immunosuppressive therapy, have been reported. Surgical excision of the head and neck of the femur was elected because the combined use of Amphotericin B and 5-fluorocytosine posed an unacceptable risk of renal damage while the use of 5-fluorocytosine alone might allow development of step-wise resistance to the drug. Femoral head and neck resection and a 7-month course of 5-fluorocytosine brought the infection under control and allowed normal would healing.

The treatment comprised intertrochanteric femoral varus osteotomy in every patient. In 20 patients (25 hips), the course of the disease was more severe than expected. The early radiological criteria for this severe course were: 1. Lateral calcification extending far laterally towards the greater trochanter, 2. Deformation and widening of the femoral head before the fragmentation phase, 3. The Saturn phenomenon; a sclerotic epiphysis surrounded by a ring of looser bony tissue, 4. Deformation and widening of the femoral neck at the initial phase of the disease, 5. Early wide sclerotic changes in the metaphysis. The overall results were poor. Two hips obtained a fair and 23 poor results. These described radiological changes are readily recognized at early phase of Perthes disease and indicate poor prognosis.

She was diagnosed as RAEB-t with the normal karyotype by peripheral blood film and bone marrow aspiration; 125 micrograms/ml of G-CSF was administered s.c. daily in order to increase neutrophil count because of the prolongation of pneumonia. Her blast cells in both peripheral blood and bone marrow showed a remarkable increase by G-CSF. After the cessation of G-CSF administration, blast cells decreased rapidly, and neutrophil count in the peripheral blood increased. Her pneumonia was then cured. After 5 months of stable hematological state, 60% of her bone marrow cells became occupied by blast cells again. So 2 consecutive courses of 14 days p.o. administration of 1,200 mg MST-16/day were tried. Three months after the first MST-16 trial, her bone marrow showed complete remission (CR) which lasted about 4 months. But she died of sepsis after the first relapse.

Eleven experimental and six control furcations, randomly assigned, are included in this report. The furcations were surgically exposed, using a flap approach and the areas were debrided. On the experimental teeth, Gore-Tex periodontal material was adapted and sutured, using a suspensory suture. The flaps were then sutured tightly, assuring complete coverage to the material. For 1 month all patients were seen weekly and rinsed their mouths with an 0.12% chlorhexidine solution daily. After 4 to 6 weeks the Gore-Tex membranes were removed. Clinical measurements were repeated at 3 and 6 months following surgery. Changes from baseline in PD and CAL were calculated for each case. Results indicated that PD measurements were reduced by both procedures, but the reduction was better for GTR at 3 and 6 months. At six months the test sites showed 2.8 +/- 1.0 mm pocket reduction, while the control sites showed an average of 1.6 +/- 0.9 mm reduction in pocket depth. CAL recordings were improved by both treatments, but were better for GTR at 6 months, with an average gain in CAL of 1.8 mm for the GTR and 0.6 mm for the controls.

Of these, 95 were personally examined. The surgical technique from 1968 to 1973 included a two-stage Harrington distraction, with fusion added at the second operation (52 patients). From 1973 to 1975, 48 patients were treated with a one-stage distraction and fusion after a week of preoperative Cotrel traction. Postoperatively, all patients were treated with a Milwaukee brace. A spinal examination and functional assessment, including a questionnaire and pain drawing, full standing anterior-posterior (AP), and lateral roentgenograms of the spine, was performed by independent observers. Eighty-five subjects without scoliosis served as a control group. The radiographic evaluation showed the usual nearly 50% permanent correction at the follow-up examination averaging nine years postoperatively. Lateral roentgenograms, however, demonstrated in 52% flattened or kyphotic cervical spines producing no significant complaints, non-significant flattening of the thoracic kyphosis, but significant lowering of the lumbar lordosis. Fifteen of the 24 patients with distal hook insertion and fusion including L4 or L5 demonstrated retrolisthesis. All had significant low-back pain. Degenerative facet joint changes and disc space narrowing was noted in 11 patients, again with a distal hook purchase in L4 or L5.

EEG investigations demonstrated seizure activity in the right motor-parietal-temporal area. Stereotaxic destruction of Forel's field and thalamus on the right side gave only brief improvement lasting several days. In view of this the frontal, temporal and a part of the parietal lobe were removed according to electrocorticographic investigations. During 6 months after the operation epileptic attacks were absent, than they recurred with increasing frequency. After 10 months full hemispherectomy was done. The child tolerated the operation very well, and control examination after 2 years showed disappearance of epileptic attacks and considerable compensation of motor power loss and sensory disturbances in the left extremities. The authors believe that hemispherectomy carried out in two stages at an interval of several months is better tolerated by the patients and makes possible better compensation of functional disturbances than classic hemispherectomy.

We suggest that insulin aggregates which may have blocked insulin receptor sites, causing insulin resistance, were removed by haemodialysis.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"diabetic ketoacidosis\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"hemodialysis\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"insulin resistance\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

The authors report here five cases. Three patients were initially with a cardiovascular collapse and all had an acute renal failure. Sodium bicarbonate haemodialysis therapy led to a dramatic improvement. Consciousness and hemodynamic status recovered rapidly. Severe metabolic and blood gases derangements were also rapidly corrected. Plasma metformin removal, appreciated by repeated blood samplings in 3 cases, was satisfactory. All patients survived. However, blood metformin levels remained abnormally high at the end of the dialytic therapy. In conclusion, (1) bicarbonate dialysis is an adequate treatment of lactic acidosis observed in diabetic patients treated with metformin since it rapidly corrects the acid-base disorders and partially removes metformin; (2) the sole accumulation of metformin is not sufficient to explain lactic acidosis since this latter might be corrected in spite of persisting high levels of blood metformin.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"lactic acidosis\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"hemodialysis\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

The treatment consisted artificial ventilation, fluid and electrolyte infusions and a six hour hemodialysis (HD) on days 2, 3 and 4. The convulsions disappeared on day 4; the patient regained consciousness on day l2 and recovered with slight sequelae. Toxicokinetic studies were conducted for a period of 12 days. The lithium (Li) serum concentration fell from 4.4 mmol/l on admission to 2.16 before HD and 0.35 after three HD. Li serum half life was 54 hours before HD, 25 hours during the three days on which HD was carried out and 106 hours thereafter. The Li cerebrospinal fluid/Li serum ratio ranged between 0.4 and 0.6 and was not influenced by HD. Mean renal clearance was 10.6 ml per min. During hemodialysis, Li serum half life decreased to 3.5 - 4.9 hours and clearance was 108 ml/min. A total amount of l28.6 mmol lithium was excreted; 84.3 mmol by HD and 44.3 mmol in urine. Patient's clinical course and electroencephalographic signs were correlated with the calculated cellular pool of Li but not with Li serum concentrations. This study confirms the effectiveness of HD to decrease the cellular pool of lithium.

The immunochemical structure of this amyloid is similar to that of the beta-2-microglobulin (beta-2m). Patients display various clinical manifestations. The variations of serum and urinary beta-2m were studied in 51 uraemic patients chronically dialyzed by means of dialyzers with cuprophan membrane, the average duration of the HD treatment being of 51.5 months. The pre- and postdialysis values of the beta-2-m were determined by Mancini radial immunodiffusion. A considerable increase--about 25 times--of serum beta-2-m was observed, which was more marked in anuric patients and those with a duration of more than 5 years of HD treatment. Among these, 15.7% show various articular manifestations (detected clinically and radiologically): a carpal tunnel syndrome (one patient required surgery) and arthropathies with various sites (scapulohumeral, knee).

Nine patients (36%) underwent repeated surgery in order to ensure adequate successful vascular access for haemodialysis, whilst only 14.1% of patients suffering from renal insifficiency of another cause had to undergo operation on more than one occasion in order to be treated. In the majority of cases vasospasm was responsible for the obliteration of internal or external arterio-venous shunts. It was particularly common in women with a normal or low blood pressure. In this group, 3/4 of the patients needed several operations in order to make dialysis possible. Fourteen patients underwent bilateral nephrectomy. One death occurred in a patient who had received a renal transplant during the same operation.

Early hypertension was exacerbated in the course of 2 pregnancies but was never severe. It preceded the late onset of renal failure which progressed slowly. The kidneys were small, with a peculiar angiographic aspect: the renal tissue was not invaded by hamartomas but the whole arterial bed was diffusely modified, with a cortical perfusion defect. Both kidneys were studied after bilateral nephrectomy. The lesions were far more complex than a simple replacement of the renal tissue by angiomyolipomas: they involved the vessels, the interstitium (with lipids inclusions surrounded by a macrophagic reaction) and the glomeruli (with focal and segmental sclerosis).

In 10 adult patients with severe type II hyperlipoproteinemia, a single HELP treatment of 3 1 plasma led to an acute decrease in the average plasma viscosity (PV) from 1.30 to 1.1 mPas. At the same time, an even more marked decrease in the mean erythrocyte aggregation rate from a pathological value of 7.9% to a value of 3.7% (normal range less than 5%) was observed. Long-term studies on five patients demonstrated a lasting improvement in these two haemorheological variables. The acute rheological changes were also accompanied by an improvement in polarographically determined muscle oxygen tension. Mean oxygen tension values measured in both the m.biceps brachii and the m.tibialis anterior in five patients before and after a single HELP treatment increased from 30 +/- 4 to 37 +/- 7 mmHg and from 27 +/- 2 to 31 +/- 3 mmHg respectively.

Six of the 29 Type D fractures failed to unite radiologically following surgery. Incorrect screw placement was a factor in two cases. The average time from injury to surgery in three of the others was seven years. Radiological evidence of screw loosening was present within two months of mobilising these cases.

Indirect immunofluorescence using the monoclonal antibody 3A7 was an effective method of detecting residual disease in the marrow. After remission was achieved by conventional therapy, the patient underwent autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT).

Ten of them were treated prospectively with a radiation-chemotherapy protocol. All but four specimens were recently reexamined and classified according to the Working Formulation system. The predominant histologic types were diffuse large cell type, large cell immunoblastic type, and diffuse mixed small and large cell type, seen in 38%, 21%, and 21% of cases, respectively. Before 1980, 16 patients were treated with postoperative radiation without definite chemotherapy, and only one has survived more than 5 years. Local recurrence was the most common cause of failure. In 1981, the authors started a protocol in which four to six courses of systemic chemotherapy with vincristine, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and prednisolone (VEPA) was given after whole brain radiation (30-40 Gy) with a local boost up to 50 to 60 Gy. Eight patients completed this protocol, and all of them are alive at 16 to 100 months after diagnosis, with three patients surviving more than 5 years. Only one patient developed recurrence. On the other hand, six patients who did not complete or receive chemotherapy after 1981 are dead or alive with recurrence. Correlation between the Working Formulation subtype and prognosis was not clear because of the variety of treatment. Two patients receiving chemotherapy developed brain necrosis, which was fatal in one case, and the other two patients treated with the protocol are in a poor state without signs of recurrence. Chemotherapy may enhance the radiation effect on normal brain tissue as well as tumor. Combination of radiotherapy and chemotherapy can improve the survival rate, but the optimal dosage needs to be investigated further.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"primary intracranial lymphoma\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"high dose radiation and systemic vincristine-doxorubicin-cyclophosphamide-prednisolone chemotherapy\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

To determine whether iron overload leads to insulin resistance before the development of insulin deficiency, insulin was infused (by euglycemic insulin-clamp technique) into 12 children with thalassemia (4 of whom were prepubertal, and 8 pubertal) who had normal or only moderately impaired glucose tolerance and who were receiving chelation therapy. Although insulin-stimulated glucose metabolism in the prepubertal children with thalassemia was similar to that in controls (normal prepubertal children) (319 +/- 23 vs. 314 +/- 41 mg per square meter of body-surface area per minute, P not significant), the response to insulin was markedly impaired in the pubertal children with thalassemia (155 +/- 18 vs. 224 +/- 15 mg per square meter per minute in normal pubertal controls, P less than 0.01). Plasma insulin levels rose excessively after oral glucose administration in the pubertal subjects with thalassemia, but not in the prepubertal patients (P less than 0.001). Furthermore, in response to a standard hyperglycemic stimulus, insulin levels in the pubertal patients rose to two to three times greater than normal and C-peptide levels became significantly elevated. Our data suggest that insulin resistance and increased insulin secretion develop in older children with thalassemia treated with long-term hypertransfusion therapy before the development of diabetes.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"thalassemia\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"hypertransfusion\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

Of the total number, 21% had an excellent response to treatment, becoming completely free from asthma and requiring no drug therapy. A further 33% had a good response, with worthwhile decrease in frequency and severity of the attacks of asthma, or a decrease in drug requirements. About half of the 46% who had a poor response had a marked subjective improvement in general well-being. Statistical evaluation of the six variables (age, sex, result, trance depth, psychological factors and severity of the asthma) confirmed the clinical impression that the ability to go into a deep trance (closely associated with the youthfulness of the subject) gives the best possibility of improvement, especially if there are significant aetiological psychological factors present and the asthma is not severe.

There were no significant differences in either the follicular phase or luteal phase hormonal profiles of estradiol and progesterone, but there was a significantly reduced pregnancy rate in those women with severe endometriosis. In part, this was due to the recovery of fewer oocytes from the endometriosis patients (P less than 0.001) despite the fact that the peak estradiol levels and ovarian accessibility were similar in the two groups. However, there were no significant differences in the proportion of oocytes that fertilized or the number that demonstrated normal embryo growth and high-grade embryo quality.

Four cases are described in which holding a retarded, ruminating child for 10-15 min before, during, and after meals, was associated with remission of rumination. Simple holding was effective in three; in the fourth, it was necessary to punish the child by putting her into a separate room for 3 min immediately after regurgitation. A within-subject reversal experimental design suggested that holding and not simple distraction was the effective component of the treatment. Treatment benefits were well maintained when the child returned to a home environment in which he or she continued to be held periodically. It is proposed that there are two behavioral etiologies for idiopathic rumination syndrome--social deprivation and reward learning through increased attention for regurgitation. Holding is the treatment of choice for the first type, and punishment with time out may be necessary to suppress regurgitation in the second type.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"rumination syndrome\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"increased holding\", \"CureRate\": \"0.75\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

These complexes have been used to treat Dpt-hypersensitive patients who suffered from chronic bronchial asthma. Clinical symptoms and medication intake were followed by filling in diary cards. Peak expiratory flow, measured four times a day, was also followed. Intradermal skin tests and bronchial challenge tests were performed with allergen together with an evaluation of nonspecific bronchial reactivity. Specific IgE and IgG antibodies were assayed after separation from the bulk of serum immunoglobulins by immunoadsorption. The study was carried out over two years according to a double-blind protocol. Intradermal inoculation of antigen-antibody complexes resulted in a marked reduction of both clinical and medication scores. No systemic side-effects were observed and only mild wheal and flare reactions were noted at the injection site. The treatment showed a drastic reduction of specific skin and bronchial reactivities with only marginal effects on nonspecific bronchial reactivity. Concentrations of specific IgE antibodies decreased significantly during the first weeks of treatment and remained at these lower values throughout the study. Specific IgG antibodies actually decreased in the majority of treated patients. The total amount of allergen used in this study was less than 1% of the amount currently used for conventional hyposensitization with the same allergen.

Median age was 54, and M/F 1.3. At diagnosis, 26 patients had refractory anaemia with an excess of blasts in transformation (RAEB-T) three had refractory anaemia (RA), 11 had refractory anaemia with excessive blasts (RAEB) and seven had chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML). Treatment was started within 3 months of diagnosis in 30 patients, and after more than 3 months in the 17 remaining patients. At the onset of treatment, 16 patients had progressed to acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Twenty-two patients (47%) reached complete remission (CR), 10 (21%) had hypoplastic death and 15 (32%) had resistant disease. Median actuarial disease-free interval was 11 months. Median actuarial survival was 14 months from diagnosis and 10 months from the onset of treatment. A significantly higher CR rate was found in patients with RAEB-T at diagnosis (69% v 19% in patients with other FAB subtypes: P = 0.008), and in patients treated within 3 months of diagnosis. Using multivariate analysis, RAEB-T at diagnosis emerged as the most powerful prognostic factor of CR achievement. Karyotype was the only significant prognostic factor of disease-free interval, with a median of 16.5 months in patients with normal karyotype versus 4 months in patients with normal findings (P = 0.018). A subgroup of 15 patients with RAEB-T at diagnosis and normal karyotype, who had a CR rate of 80% and a median actuarial disease-free interval of 18 months, could be identified. Our results confirm that, overall, intensive chemotherapy has limited efficacy in MDS, especially when compared with allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Relatively favourable results were obtained in our patients with RAEB-T at diagnosis, however, particularly those with normal karyotype.

The patient was successfully treated with interferon-alpha (IF-alpha). In the fifth year of treatment with IF-alpha the morphology of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and of bone marrow infiltration changed with the appearance of numerous small to intermediate shaped lymphocytes of a T-helper phenotype.

Although some successful reports of intra-arterial chemotherapy for HCC. have been documented, most of the therapeutic effects are transient and the survival rate is not satisfactory. This report is of a rare case, that of a long-term survivor with HCC treated by intra-arterial chemotherapy and immunotherapy.

On admission, serum AFP was within normal range, HBs-Ag was negative, and ICG-R 15 was 20.8%. On hepatic angiogram, a hypervascular tumor (6 cm in size) was recognized in the middle of the right lobe.

The infection rate was 0.4 per cent, and the nonunion rate was 0.8 per cent. Shortening of more than 2 cm. was seen in seven cases (3 per cent), and malrotation of more than 20 degrees was noted in four cases (1.7 per cent). These more common problems of shortening and rotation were almost eliminated by the increased use of cerclage wire and postoperative traction and spica casts. Knee range of motion averaged 128 degrees. These fractures provide interesting and difficult challenges. Intramedullary nailing of the segmental fractures is technically demanding but offers excellent results in these otherwise difficult fractures. Patients with grade I and grade II comminuted fractures do well with intramedullary nailing and the bones remain stable. Grade III and grade IV comminuted fractures are unstable and pose the risk of shortening and rotation. Therefore, to gain anatomic restoration in a young person we believe that it is reasonable to perform an open reduction and cerclage wiring of these fractures. The postoperative treatment of the comminuted femoral fracture is determined by both fracture stability and patient reliability, and frequent roentgenograms are indicated. Most importantly, the surgeon should be prepared to apply whatever form of treatment he believes to be necessary to gain optimal results in each individual.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"comminuted fractures of the femoral shaft\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"intramedullary nailing\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

The study was carried out on 45 female patients, aged between 34 and 61 years, undergoing cholecystectomy who were randomly divided into three groups. Group 1 (age: 50.33 +/- 8.64 years) received 100 ml of 5% mannitol solution i.v.; group 2 (age: 49.80 +/- 11.11 years) 100 ml of a mannitol solution containing 7.5 mg/kg L-tryptophan; and group 3 (age: 53.46 +/- 9.60 years) 100 ml of a mannitol solution containing 15 mg/kg L-tryptophan. Vital capacity (preoperative VC) was measured before surgery. Anesthesia used was isoflurane. Narcotics or neuroleptics were not used. Pain was assessed before treatment (T-0 min), at the end of administration (T-30) and at T-60, 120, 180, 240, 300 and 360 min by the following variables: respiratory rate (RR), heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP), Scott-Huskisson test (VAS), pain vital capacity (PVC), analgesic vital capacity (AVC), and respiratory restoration factor (RRF) calculated from Bromage's formula (RRF = (AVC - PVC/preoperative VC - PVC) X 100). As regards variables RR, HR, MAP and VAS, differences between the values from T-30 to T-360 and the value at T-0 were calculated. Means and S.E.M. were calculated on the obtained values and on RRF values for each group. The significance of the differences between groups was calculated using Student's t test and Bonferroni's test. Results show a significant decrease of pain in groups 2 and 3 treated with L-tryptophan, in comparison with group 1 (controls). No significant difference was observed between the treated groups, although more lasting pain relief was observed in group 3 in comparison with group 2.

Nonetheless, the pregnancy rates following embryo transfer were similar for all groups, suggesting that once fertilization is achieved, all embryos have the same potential to result in a successful pregnancy.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"oligospermic infertility\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"in-vitro fertilization\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

Treatments were 15 rad given twice weekly, calculated to midpelvis, to a total dose of 150 rad. Toxicity was confined to thrombocytopenia, one-third of patients requiring interruptions in the treatment course to allow platelet count recovery. Five patients had additional local irradiation. Complete responses were seen in 80% of patients and partial responses in 20%. Sixteen patients (64%) have been in continuous, unmaintained remission since treatments for variable periods to 39 months. Of 9 patients with clinically recurrent disease, 3 received further TBI and are in remission, 3 are in remission on chemotherapy, one patient has died, failing on all therapy, and 2 have not been treated. One patient died of pneumonia at 12 months, without clinical evidence of disease. Overall, actuarial survival is 87% at 2 years and compares well with survival in a sequential combination drug treated group of patients matched for age, sex, and histology, though differences are not statistically significant in these small groups.

Important prognostic factors were: histology (malignant teratoma intermediate (MTI), malignant teratoma undifferentiated (MTU), T-category (T4, T less than 4), clinical regional and juxta-regional subdiaphragmatic lymph node involvement (N0, N1,2, N3,4) and vascular invasion in the orchidectomy specimen (V-, V+).

Aspects on treatment modalities with reference to a study on patients treated by irradiation.\nAbstract: Irradiation is the most common form of treatment of tonsillar region carcinomas in Scandinavia. During recent years, encouraging results have been reported when surgery has been performed. Therefore, an effort was made to compare different treatment principles on the basis of a study on patients treated by irradiation. This retrospective study comprised 37 patients over a 20-year period. The relative 5-year survival was 33%. Most of the patients died in the next two years after diagnosis. Seventy-three percent of the patients initially had signs of regional metastasis. Hardly 20% of these were still alive after 5 years, while patients without evidence of metastasis had a 5-year survival of 50%. Neither the size, nor the histopathological features of the primary tumor seemed to affect the incidence of regional metastasis. The duration of symptoms before diagnosis, however, seemed to influence prognosis. Surgical consideration alone, or in combination with irradiation, should be made in cases with large primary tumor with regional lymph node involvement. In other cases, however, there was no evidence suggesting surgery as a better form of therapy than irradiation alone.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"tonsillar region carcinoma\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"irradiation\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

A prolonged chest pain (more than two hours) with a major electrocardiographic lesion in the posterior leads needed an urgent coronary arteriography in order to attempt a recanalization. Antecedents of arteriopathy of the lower limbs with aortobifemoral bypass required an axillary artery right side approach. A selective right coronary opacification showed complete occlusion at the junction of segments 1 and 2. An intracoronary injection of isosorbide dinitrate relieved a coronary spasm and allowed a complete visualization of the right coronary artery. This appeared to be very atherosclerotic with several severe narrowings, and a subocclusive lesion at the site of the initial occlusion. Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasties (PTCA) were performed and led to real 'restructuring' of the right coronary artery. The clinical outcome was excellent without recurrent angina pectoris. An angiographic control performed 6 months after PTCA demonstrated the persistence of the coronary recanalization and an evident improvement of the segmental contractility. This report emphasizes the role of coronary spasm in the genesis of myocardial infarction and shows that PTCA may be performed as a first approach at the acute phase of myocardial infarction; to our knowledge it is the first PTCA performed by an axillary approach at the acute stage of myocardial infarction.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"myocardial infarction\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"isosorbide dinitrate, transluminal angioplasty\", \"CureRate\": \"1.0\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [\"coronary angiography,intracoronary injection of isosorbide dinitrate\"], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

Five of the patients had been operated upon before by various methods, and four of the cases were unilateral and untreated before. The operation was performed under general anaesthesia using the operating microscope. The pharyngeal mucosa was protected by a saline-soaked packing in the nasal pharynx. No stent was used in the postoperative period. Normal air passage was obtained in six patients, and one patient, who had co-existing adhesions through the whole nasal cavity after previous treatment by dilation, achieved a limited air passage after one laser treatment, and further attempts were postponed until he grew older. One patient did not want another try after one failure. One patient has been operated recently, and the result is uncertain. Laser-treatment of choanal atresia seems to make other methods of operation obsolete for the following reasons: The operation is easy and quick and of slight discomfort to the patient. The time of hospitalization is short, and the operation can be repeated, if a good result is not achieved in the first try.

The most efficient treatment has, until now, been dermoplasty of the nasal septum and cavity. There have been a few reports on treatment with CO2-, argon- or Nd-YAG-lasers, which have been encouraging. Ten patients with Osler's disease were treated for severe epistaxis. Three were treated with CO2-laser, two of these under general anaesthesia. Seven patients were treated with the argon laser under local anaesthesia. A variety of other sites were treated at the same time for functional or cosmetic reasons (mouth, face, fingers, rectum). Good results were obtained in eight cases. In three of the cases the observation period was more than two years. A second treatment has been necessary in three cases. Two other patients were treated recently, and it is too early to judge the results. The argon-laser is more convenient for this purpose than the CO2-laser. The method is quick and reliable and there is no need for hospitalization. The treatment can be repeated without permanent damage to the function of the nose.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"laser surgery\", \"CureRate\": \"0.8\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

Among side effects, oncogenic problem and late radiation change are most undesirable and may become fatal. Hence, we avoid radiation therapy especially for younger aged patients. We prefer surgical therapy to radiotherapy for such a case. In our clinic, laser therapy has been employed. A laser beam is introduced through an operation microscope and a lesion can be microscopically vaporized. In this study, a survey of 40 patients with T1 glottic cancer submitted to laser surgery was reviewed. From those patients 25 were T1a and 15 were T1b. From our experience, laser vaporization is recommendable for T1 glottic cancer in younger aged patients.

In this multi-institute non-randomized study, the five-year cumulative survival rate was 70% for the former group and 49% for the latter. The prognosis was more favorable among patients who responded to preoperative chemotherapy than among those who did not. Limb-salvage surgery was feasible for most of the surgical stage IIB patients with small extraosseous tumor extensions who had responded to preoperative chemotherapy. Local tumor recurrences were seen in 15 (14%) of the 107 patients in the limb-salvage surgery group, nine of whom died of the metastasis. While limb-salvage surgery is being increasingly used in Japan, present indications show the procedure not to reduce survival rate for osteosarcoma patients. The survival rate of patients with wide-with-marginal margins was similar to that of patients with wide margins. Taking into account the long-term survival of osteosarcoma patients, limb-salvage surgery can be recommended when the osteosarcoma responds to preoperative chemotherapy.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"osteosarcoma\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"limb-salvage surgery\", \"CureRate\": \"0.7\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

At least 1 cm of normal parenchyma surrounded the tumour and no microscopic invasion of resection margins was evident. The disease was staged according to our own staging system. Lobectomy was performed in 50 patients and non-anatomical resection in the remainder. The postoperative mortality rate was 5 per cent and the major morbidity rate was 11 per cent. The actuarial 5-year survival rate for patients in stages I, II and III was 42 per cent, 34 per cent and 15 per cent respectively (P less than 0.001). The overall actuarial 5-year survival rate was 30 per cent. The prognostic importance of various patient and tumour variables was evaluated by univariate analysis and then by multivariate analysis. Age of patient, site of primary, disease-free interval between treatment of primary and of hepatic metastases, preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen levels, and number of metastases, did not relate to prognosis, while sex (P = 0.024), stage of primary (P = 0.026), extent of liver involvement (P less than 0.001), distribution of metastases (P = 0.01) and type of surgery (P = 0.028) significantly affected prognosis as single factors. Multivariate analysis revealed that only the extent of liver involvement and stage of the primary tumour were independent predictors of survival. We conclude that liver resection is effective in selected patients with hepatic metastases from colorectal cancer. In resectable patients it is not yet possible to formulate a clear prognosis based on clinical factors. The extent of liver involvement and the staging system used may be significant, although not absolute, indicators of outcome.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"hepatic metastases from colorectal cancer\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"liver resection\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

These cases ranged from 24-72 years of age (average 42), 11 were males and 12 females. There were 19 primary cases and 4 postoperative cases of recurrence, and the period of their clinical courses ranged from 2 months to 23 years. Concerning the operative procedure, in 22 cases the approach was via an upper midline incision and 1 case the approach was via left thoraco-abdominal incision. Intraoperative manometry was performed to help in judging the extent of each manipulation. With the operative manipulation, the LESP is reduced to 13.0 +/- 6.0 mmHg (39% of the average preoperative value) and HPZ is elongated to 60.9 +/- 14.1 mm (155% of the average preoperative value). Moreover, post-operative manometry data resembled intra-operative data. The effectiveness of the procedure is judged on the basis of the chief complaints, esophagography, endoscopic examination, esophageal manometry and 24-hr pH monitoring. Patients are followed up at 2 weeks, 3 months and 1 year from the operation. Results showed 22 excellent cases (96.65%), 1 fair case (4.34%). These are better results than those of other reports that showed 50-60% excellent results and 30% good results (remaining slight passage disturbance). The reason for this difference is that we obtain sufficient LESP decompression effect (myotomy + submucosal layer ablation) based on intraoperative manometry. In the only case that we judged as fair (a reoperated case after Heller's operation) showed severe EGR totalling 213 min. on 24-hr pH monitoring of the esophagus in the postoperative period and was erosion also seen in the lower esophagus endoscopically. In this case, the LESP was 6.0 mmHg and its HPZ is 27.0 mm, showing a higher HPZ than the non-reflux group. Among the non-reflux group, LESP was as low as 6.0 mmHg, and this case had a remarkable long HPZ of 57.0 mm. In conclusion, even though the LESP is low, it is possible to prevent reflux if the HPZ is sufficiently long.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"esophageal achalasia\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"long myotomy + partial fundopexy + posterior fixation based on intraoperative manometry\", \"CureRate\": \"0.9665\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

Radiating pain and weakness occurred when she tried to stand up on Dec. 25 in 1989. She was admitted to our hospital in October 1990. Physical examination showed emaciation, hypesthesia of extremities, hypesthesia over the right chest and back, impaired vibration and position sense, and hyperreflexia. Laboratory findings revealed that the erythrocyte sedimentation rate was elevated to 46mm/hr, rheumatoid factor (RF) to 83.1IU/ml and CRP to 3.7mg/dl. Her blood sugar was high and she was diagnosed as having diabetes mellitus. Cervical X ray film showed atlanto-axial subluxation. A pseudotumor around the odontoid process bulging into the spinal canal and compression of the upper cervical cord was observed by MRI. In spite of administration of bucillamine (100mg/day), the size of pseudotumor did not change. Methotrexate (MTX) at a dose of 5mg/week was started in February 1991 and the pseudotumor decreased in size with a concurrent reduction of ESR, RF and CRP.

To determine if lesions that are likely to recur may be predicted at the time of surgery, data from 5020 patients with 7010 basal-cell carcinomas treated with Mohs' technique were reviewed. Two thousand nine hundred sixty (2960) lesions with five-year follow-up were studied (overall recurrence rate = 2.6%). Sex and age of the patients, size and location of lesions, types of previous therapy, and the number of surgical stages of microscopically controlled excision were all found to correlate significantly with recurrence rate (p less than 0.01). Multiple regression analysis was performed to determine the relative contribution of each of these variables to predictability of recurrences by a weighted scoring system. The derived model delineated the lesions into no-risk, low-, medium-, and high-risk groupings (p less than 0.000001). Lesions in the high-risk group had a recurrence rate of 10.1%, almost four times greater than the average.

In the following years the right orbicularis oris muscle and platysma were unilaterally and progressively involved in the spasms and with increasing frequency. Medical treatment with minor transquilizer was not effective. She was referred to our department at the age of 16. CT and MRI revealed no abnormality. Angiographical study revealed that the right PICA (posterior inferior cerebellar artery) was tourtously coming off from a relatively high portion of the right vertebral artery. The trunk of the right AICA (anterior inferior cerebellar artery) was not able to be identified. Although the onset of this condition was unusually early, the clinical course and symptoms of hemifacial spasm were so clearly typical that she underwent microvascular decompression surgery on July 26, 1988, at the age of 16. During the operation an upward looping PICA was found crossing and tightly compressing the exit zone of the right facial nerve. The offending artery seemed to be elastic without significant atherosclerotic change. The arterial loop was carefully dissected and replaced with two pieces of sponge prosthesis between the artery and the surface of brain stem. Her hemifacial spasm completely disappeared post-operatively. No recurrence has been noted for over one year in the follow-up observation. Hemifacial spasm is subacutely or chronically a progressive disorder of facial involuntary movement. The arterial compression in the exit zone of the facial nerve is said to be the cause of the disorder and microvascular decompression has been indicated for it since a little before the beginning of this decade.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"juvenile hemifacial spasm\", \"Symptoms\": [\"intermittent involuntary spasms of the right lower orbicularis oculi muscle\"], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"microvascular decompression surgery\", \"CureRate\": \"1.0\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [\"computed tomography (CT),magnetic resonance imaging (MRI),angiography\"], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

The cases were collected through a cooperative effort of 57 surgeons at eight hospitals in the Detroit area and coordinated by the Michigan Cancer Foundation where data collection and analyses were completed. The primary treatment of all patients was a modified radical mastectomy. Of the 1,078 cases accessioned between October 1975 and April 1983, 537 were found to have no microscopic lymph node involvement and 462 of these cases received no adjuvant antineoplastic therapy. The period of follow-up of these cases (alive, n = 358) has been 78.75 +/- 24.6 months (mean +/- SD). Overall, the cumulative 6-year recurrence rate as calculated by life table analysis was 26%, with 16.8% dying of their disease. Tumor size was an important prognostic factor; the recurrence rate was 16.2% for those with primaries measuring less than or equal to 1 cm, with only a 6.3% mortality. Patients with tumors measuring greater than 5 cm also did well: 13.7% recurrence and 13.7% mortality rates at 6 years.

Each patient was operated on in a single-stage procedure by anterior discectomy, without bone fusion, for protrusions between 2 and 4 mm, and by vertebral trephination and intercorporeal iliac bone-graft fusion for protrusions larger than 4 mm. There were no serious complications. Improvement by one clear disability grade (as defined by the authors) was observed in 36% of the cases, by two grades in 56%, and by three grades in 8%. No patient showed an improvement of four grades. During a follow-up period varying from 2 to 5 years, none of the patients showed clinical evidence of progression of myelopathy; however, 44% of patients showed definite radiological evidence of progression of cervical spondylosis.

Operation was performed eighteen months at least after injury, during which period rehabilitation was necessary to prevent atrophy of the pectoralis major and contracture in internal rotation. The strength of flexion was improved by alterations of the original Clark's operation. The whole muscle was transplanted: its humeral tendon was fixed to the coracoid process; its thoracic extremity lengthened by an aponevrotic flap from rectus anterior was pulled through a posterior anti-brachial incision, holding the arm in anteposition and the forearm in supination. A strong tension was obtained in this way. Transplantation of teres major and latissimus dorsi tendons behind the humerus was done in the same stage. Results are in favor of these improvements: all seven patients, including two hard-workers, obtained a strong and large flexion. The useful part of external rotation was restored.

The remaining 20 patients, of whom a highly significant number had alien tissue, had not had an early convulsion before the onset of focal epilepsy. The importance of accurate clinical histories is stressed. Clinical considerations alone predicted the pathology and laterality of the lesion in more than half the series. Regular EEG recordings and repeat scanning were found to be important investigations. Major disorders of behaviour had occurred in 44 patients. As adults, the series were free of severe psychiatric symptoms, but many required years of careful rehabilitation. 31 children had been excluded from normal schools before operation. Postoperatively, many patients continued their education in normal schools. Some required basic remedial teaching, others successfully undertook higher education and training. 49 patients benefited over-all from neurosurgical treatment. 34 had no more habitual epilepsy at all. Full global gains often took at least five years to achieve.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"focal epilepsy\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"neurosurgery\", \"CureRate\": \"0.68\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [\"periodic EEG recordings,repeat scans\"], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

Review of 345 consecutive cases treated over a period of 12 years.\nAbstract: This paper reports experience with 345 patients admitted to a neurosurgical department after an aneurysm rupture. At the time of admission, patients were separated into two groups: the patients unsuitable for planned surgery and called 'unoperable'; the patients planned for surgery and called 'operable patients' (328 patients). The general management attitude consisted of deferred surgery according to the clinical status of the patients and the risk of vasospasm and ischaemia. Of these, 18 died before the day of surgery, and are called 'operable and non-operated' patients. The cause of death was vasospasm and ischaemia in 10 cases and recurrence of haemorrhage in 8 cases. 310 patients were actually operated upon. Their final outcome was: good 70%, fair 9.6%, poor 7.7%, death 12.5%. This paper discusses the risk of SAH recurrence and the risk of vasospasm and ischaemia during the waiting time before surgery, in the attitude of deferred surgery which was elected in most cases of this series and compares the outcome with other published series.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"ruptured intra-cranial aneurysm\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"neurosurgery\", \"CureRate\": \"0.7\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

Fat absorption and intestinal mucosal morphology were normal in all 5. 2 children were given nutritional supplementation by nasogastric intubation, 1 received nightly oral formula supplements, and 2 were supplemented with zinc, iron, folate, and vitamin E only. Nutritional supplementation by the nasogastric route produced a rapid sustained increase in growth rate, associated with striking reductions in pain crises and infections which had previously necessitated many hospital admissions. Oral supplementation improved the clinical course but had no effect on growth rate. Mineral and vitamin supplements influenced neither the growth rate nor the clinical course.

After resection of the sequestra, all four patients had significant bone defects of the anterior tibial cortex extending to the ankle joint. The average number of failed previous surgical procedures was 5.8. The average patient age was 35.3 years. The intervals of nonunion averaged 24.8 months. In two patients, the hBMP, including other low molecular weight bone matrix noncollagenous proteins (hBMP/NCP), was implanted across the fracture site in polylactic-polyglycollic acid strips (1 X 13 cm) as an onlay graft. In one patient, the BMP was implanted in the fracture gap in absorbable gelatin (No. 5 capsules). In another patient, the BMP/NCP was also implanted in the form of a composite of cortical allogeneic bone in addition to a capsule of BMP/NCP. In all four cases, alignment was restored and the bone ends were stabilized with internal fixation. Preoperatively, the ankle joints were ankylosed and painful. Healed fractures and functional ankle joints were observed in three of four patients at an average of 4.4 months. In one patient, the fracture healed but the joint remained ankylosed.

The valvular dysfunction had included aortic, mitral and tricuspid regurgitations. He had also complicated severe hepatic dysfunction due to the cardiac constriction and the secondary tricuspid valve regurgitation.

Twenty-two patients (17 males, 5 females) with spontaneous bacteremia (n = 7) or bacterial peritonitis (n = 15) were treated with oral pefloxacin 400 mg per 24 hr alone (n = 1) or in combination with another oral antibiotic, trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole (n = 13), amoxicillin (n = 6), cefadroxil (n = 2), or metronidazole (n = 1). In patients with spontaneous bacteremia, all organisms were found to be sensitive to oral antibiotics, and a favorable response was elicited in 6 out of 7 (86 p. cent) within 3 days (mean) of treatment. In patients with spontaneous peritonitis, ascitic fluid cultures were positive in 11 cases, and organisms were sensitive to pefloxacin in 9 out of 11 cases. A favorable response was elicited in 13 out of 15 within 2 to 8 days of treatment. Fourteen patients died (64 p. cent), 3 of infection (bacteremia n = 1, peritonitis n = 2), and 11 patients of causes unrelated to infection, mainly variceal hemorrhage, hepatorenal syndrome or hepatocellular carcinoma, although the clinical symptoms of infection were controlled. One-year survival was 57 p. cent in patients with bacteremia and 33 p. cent in those with bacterial peritonitis. Oral treatment was well tolerated in all patients. We suggest that most bacteremia and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in cirrhotic patients can be treated with oral antibiotics.

Our purpose was to determine whether or not patients with a low risk of relapse can be identified at the time of the initial staging evaluation. In 30 of 82 patients (Group 1), embryonal carcinoma constituted less than 80 percent of the tumor, no vessel invasion was present, and the preorchiectomy serum AFP level was less than 80 ng/dL. No relapses occurred in this group. Fifty-two patients (Group 2) had more than 80 percent embryonal carcinoma or vessel invasion or a serum AFP level higher than 80 ng/dL. Relapse occurred in 24 (46%) of these patients. The difference in the rate of relapse between patients in Group 1 and Group 2 was statistically significant (P less than 0.00001). A separate analysis of teratoma as a predictor of nonrelapse showed that the orchiectomy specimens of 30 of the 82 patients contained more than 50 percent teratoma. Only 1 relapse occurred among 25 patients with more than 50 percent teratoma and no vessel invasion. Our data show that there is a subgroup of patients with clinical Stage I nonseminomatous germ cell tumor who have a very low rate of relapse.

Serum laboratory findings included elevation of serum bilirubin and AST, prolongation of serum prothrombin time and a positive monospot. A tentative diagnosis of acute fatty liver of pregnancy was made, and a healthy male infant was delivered by emergency cesarean section because of fetal distress. Over the subsequent 3 days, acute progressive oliguric renal failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation, hypoglycemia requiring intravenous dextrose infusion and pancreatitis developed; her mental status progressed to stage III encephalopathy. Quantitative computed tomography estimated the liver volume to be 770 cm3. The decision to proceed with orthotopic liver transplantation was made on the basis of progressive clinical deterioration despite aggressive support and because of her small liver size. After transplant, the patient's multisystem failure rapidly reversed. Histopathological examination of the native liver demonstrated predominantly zone 3 microvesicular steatosis with characteristic ultrastructural changes consistent with acute fatty liver of pregnancy. Southern blot analysis for Epstein-Barr virus DNA was negative.

A variant treated by pancreatoduodenectomy.\nAbstract: Acute pancreatitis usually subsides spontaneously or is complicated by pseudocysts, pancreatic necrosis, or abscesses. We describe an uncommon variant of acute pancreatitis in which signs of inflammation persist over a number of months, waxing and waning but never disappearing. Neither identifiable collections nor other targets for surgical drainage develop in these patients, nor does their condition ever remit enough to allow them to leave the hospital. Eating provokes a flareup of inflammation. We have treated five such patients with a pancreatoduodenectomy (four patients) or total pancreatectomy (one patient). Each patient had been continuously hospitalized for six to 12 weeks before operation. All survived the operation and left the hospital eating solid food within 16 days. In addition to acute inflammation and fat necrosis, the resected specimens showed main pancreatic duct stenosis or occlusion in three patients, a pancreaticoduodenal fistula in one, and a congenital duplication cyst. Pancreatography or cholangiography showed the lesion in three of four cases and helped in planning therapy. Thus, acute pancreatitis may fall to remit because of proximal pancreatic duct obstruction, for which pancreatoduodenectomy is a reasonable and effective treatment.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"acute pancreatitis\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"pancreatoduodenectomy\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

Contrary to earlier beliefs, this tumor does not arise from the synovial lining of joints and bursa but develops from pleuripotential mesenchymal cells through abnormal differentiation into synovial neoplasms. Microscopically the tumor is characterized by a biphasic pattern of pseudoepithelial cells and a spindle cell element with fibrosarcomatous appearance. One additional case of synovial sarcoma of the endolarynx is reported. The tumor arose from the right subglottic area and presented submucosally. It was treated by extended frontolateral partial vertical (hemi) laryngectomy. The patient is alive and well 3 years after surgery.

She had no personal or family history of stigmas of tuberous sclerosis. On physical examination, a movable hard smooth mass of fist size was palpable in the right abdomen. Drip infusion pyelography revealed an elevation of right kidney. Ultrasonography revealed that the abdominal mass had a high amplitude echo area.

Selection of the patients was based solely on arteriographic criteria. Arteriography after dilatation showed considerable widening of the stenosed area in all patients. In 65 patients the effect of treatment on the blood pressure was assessed during follow up periods of one to four years. In 14 of these patients the hypertension was cured, in 29 it was improved, and in 22 there was no change. Patients with fibromuscular lesions benefited distinctly more than did those with atheromatous stenosis, only one of the 21 patients with fibromuscular lesions showing no change as compared with 21 of the 44 patients with atheromatous lesions. The only serious complication encountered was microcholesterol emboli, which developed in two patients with severe atheromatous lesions of the aorta. In the atheromatous group age and overall renal function had no influence on the blood pressure response. In the subgroup of patients with a unilateral lesion the renal vein renin ratios and asymmetrical curves obtained by renography had only a very limited predictive value. In experienced hands percutaneous transluminal arterial dilatation is relatively safe, and this study suggests that it should be attempted in all patients with renal artery stenosis.

Follow-up study of 2-18 months showed a continuing gradient decrease in seven of eight patients. No aneurysm was found in this series, probably related to the appropriate balloon size. Our data suggest that balloon angioplasty is a safe and effective method in relief of the stenosis by congenital membranous aortic coarctation and postoperative restenosis of the coarcted aorta.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"congenital aortic coarctation\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"percutaneous transluminal balloon angioplasty\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

A 42-year-old man was admitted for a heart murmur and abnormal findings in the screening chest roentgenogram. Having no symptoms on admission, his physical activity was evaluated as Class I according to the classification of the New York Heart Association. A systolic murmur (Levine III/VI) with split second sound was audible at the left sternal border in the 3rd intercostal space. Chest roentgenogram revealed 57% of the cardio-thoracic ratio and no signs of increased pulmonary vascular markings. ECG showed incomplete right bundle branch block. Echocardiography and right ventriculography visualized the supravalvular membranous structured stenosed pulmonary artery 1cm above the pulmonic valve. Systolic pressure gradient between the right ventricle and the distal main pulmonary trunk was 54mmHg. The patient was diagnosed as having pulmonary supravalvular membranous stenosis. PTBD was applied using Inoue balloon catheter, where inflation was initiated from approximately 120% of pulmonary arterial diameter and terminated at 150%. This procedure decreased systolic pressure gradient from 54mmHg to 36mmHg without complication. After PTBD right ventriculography demonstrated that a part of the membranous structure had become floppy and movable. Pulmonary arterial diameter was unchanged. We considered that PTBD tore the membranous structure, which consequently resulted in the decrease of systolic pressure gradient. Systolic murmur diminished to Levine II/VI. Six months later, cardiac catheterization showed no change in systolic pressure gradient compared with that immediately after PTBD. This is the first report on pulmonary supravalvular membranous stenosis successfully treated with PTBD.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"pulmonary supravalvular membranous stenosis\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"percutaneous transluminal balloon dilatation\", \"CureRate\": \"1.0\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [\"chest roentgenogram,Echocardiography,right ventriculography\"], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

Thirteen patients (29%) survived 2 months or longer after dialysis treatment (\"survivors\"). Thirty-one patients (71%) died within this period (\"nonsurvivors\"). The main factor distinguishing survivors was the frequency of sepsis (none of 13 survivors vs 17 of 31 nonsurvivors). Preexisting malignancy and total number of acute insults to renal function were significantly less frequent, and immediate clinical and biochemical outcome of dialysis significantly better in survivors. The overall complication rate of dialysis was high (31 of 44 patients), but was significantly lower in survivors. Acute peritoneal dialysis is a useful procedure in the management of ARF in the elderly. However, we suggest that elderly patients in whom sepsis is a contributory factor to the development of ARF do not benefit from peritoneal dialysis therapy.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"acute renal failure\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"peritoneal dialysis\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

Therefore, valves of 24 CAPD patients (ages 55 +/- 11 years; CAPD duration: 29 +/- 28 months) were studied in a prospective echocardiographic and Doppler echocardiographic follow-up analysis over 35 months. Most frequent findings were sclerosis of the aortic annulus (100% at both assessments) and of the anterior mitral valve leaflet (first vs. follow-up assessment: 88 vs. 96%). Sclerosis of the mitral valve annulus (58% vs. 63%), right coronary (54 vs. 63%) and noncoronary (50 vs. 67%) cuspis of the aortic valve and of the posterior mitral valve leaflet (25 vs. 50%) were less frequent but tended to be progressive (p = NS).

Open study in 10 patients.\nAbstract: Ten patients with bullous pemphigoid underwent low volume plasma exchange (1/3 to 1/2 of the plasmatic mass) 3 times a week for 2 to 6 weeks followed, in some of them, by maintenance corticosteroid therapy. Eight patients benefited from this treatment. Complete control of the disease was obtained with PE alone in 3: low-dose corticosteroids were sufficient to procure remission in 2, and dosage could be reduced in 3 patients who previously required high doses of corticosteroids. No serious side-effects were recorded. The best results were observed in patients who had been ill for less than 3 months. Thus, low volume plasma exchanges make it possible to obtain clinical improvement while avoiding the rebound phenomena sometimes observed after high volume plasma exchanges.

A diagnosis of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) was then made, and treatment with steroids, anti-platelet agents, transfusion of fresh frozen plasma was started.

After delivery she continued to have active TTP with thrombocytopenia which responded repeatedly to plasma infusion though their frequency gradually decreased to about one unit every 3-4 weeks. Three years after the birth of the first child she conceived again and was easily managed with repeated plasma infusions although the frequency and amount of plasma required to prevent thrombocytopenia were increased. She delivered a normal 3.4 kg term baby after which she again had a decreased plasma requirement. This is the first report of a woman with 5 years of active TTP managed with plasma alone. She experienced two pregnancies in which both mother and infant survived. We believe that the use of plasma in the management of TTP during pregnancy will improve the survival rate of both mother and infant. At the time of second birth, the platelet count was low in the mother but normal in the baby.

Thirty seven of these patients are alive and well after five years and the remaining nine have died of other causes up to four years later: there was no evidence of recurrence in any of these cases. Fourteen patients underwent a subsequent major surgical resection and residual tumour was found at the site of polypectomy in two cases but regional lymph nodes were not involved. Only one patient from this group with a high grade tumour developed metastases although the operative specimen was free of tumour. Malignant polyps can be successfully treated by polypectomy alone provided both the laboratory techniques of examination and the histopathological criteria are strictly applied.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"malignant colorectal polyps\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"polypectomy\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

Five patients with liver cirrhosis and portal hypertension have been studied with intravehous (IVGTT, 0,5 g/Kg B.W.) and oral (OGTT, 1 g/Kg B.W.) glucose tolerance tests before and three weeks after PCA. Fasting plasma glucose was 84 +/- 7 before and 87 +/- 3 mg/dl after PCA. Fasting IRI increased from 17 +/- 3 to 31 +/- 6 microU/ml. The pattern of plasma glucose and IRI response to IVGTT did not change after PCA. Plasma glucose resonse to OGTT after PCA showed only an earlier rise at 60 instead of 90 minutes, whereas IRI resonse (area under the insulin curve) was significantly enhanced (from 12.4 to 19.8 U/l, p &lt; 0.05).

All had been treated by an extremely rigorous conservative regime in which the patients were kept in hospital for an average period of twenty-six months, during which time they were confined to bed with the legs in wide abduction, first in traction and later in \"broomstick\" plasters to ensure \"containment\" of the femoral head. The patients were assessed by the joint clincial and radiological method described by Ratliff (1956). The results were very satisfactory, with only 2 per cent poor results and 10 per cent fair. The remaining 88 per cent were good. The radiological results at the end of treatment have also been compared with control series described by Catterall (1972) and with the osteotomy series of Lloyd-Roberts, Catterall and Salamon (1976). From this it appears that the described regime offers no benefit compared with the natural history in Catterall's Groups I and II, and in Group III the results were only marginally better than those following osteotomy. In Group IV cases, however, where the femoral head was totally involved, the benefit was important, and since these are the cases which carry the worst natural prognosis it is suggested that the use of the method described in such instances must be seriously considered in spite of its social disadvantages. The theoretical implications of the findings are considered, and it is concluded that the benefits of the method cannot be ascribed wholly to the application of the \"containment\" principle.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"perthes' disease\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"prolonged recumbency and femoral head containment\", \"CureRate\": \"0.88\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

Possibly, this reaction has a nonspecific character and reflects the reaction of circulation to stabilization of the patients' condition.

Langerhans' cell (LC) and T-cell were stained immunohistochemically on the specimens excised from the cervical cancer. In squamous cell carcinoma, 5-year survival rates for patients with LC infiltration were significantly better than those without LC (78% versus 60%; P &lt; 0.01). The 5-year survival rate of patients with T-cell infiltration also was significantly better than that of patients without such infiltration (83% versus 61%; P &lt; 0.05). Similar trends were observed in patients with adenocarcinoma; 5-year survival rates for patients with LC infiltration and those without LC infiltration were 49% and 25%, respectively (P &lt; 0.025). The survival rates for patients with T-cell infiltration and those without were 50% and 33%, respectively (P &lt; 0.1). An analysis of patterns of failure of radiation therapy demonstrated that the favorable prognosis in LC infiltration was attributable mainly to improvement of local control rates, but that in T-cell infiltration was not. T-cells infiltrated into tumor specifically in the patients with LC infiltration in both cell types. The authors suggest that the host anti-cancer immune response of individual patients may be remarkably different at the first step of antigen recognition by LC. The LC may induce T-cell-mediated antitumor response and improve local response in radiation therapy.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"cervical cancer\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"radiation therapy\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

Evaluation and considerations.\nAbstract: Radiotherapy was applied in 64 of 88 cases of cervical esophagus cancer during the period 1968 to 1980. The lesions treated were 49 epitheliomas of the esophageal opening, excluding hypopharyngeal tumors extending into the esophagus, and 15 epitheliomas of the remaining cervical segment of the esophagus. Survival did not exceed 2 years in any patient, and the reasons for these poor results are investigated. These included the particular selection of patients, the choice of radiotherapy as basic treatment, and the dosage administered. A new therapeutic approach is proposed based on pathologic findings and the various therapeutic measures available. Preoperative chemotherapy is followed by a total laryngopharyngectomy, with a total esophagectomy without opening the thorax and under certain well defined conditions. Continuity is re-established by a gastropharyngostomy, and postoperative radiotherapy is given routinely. This very heavy therapeutic approach, is appropriate for selected patients only, other cases having, unfortunately, to make do with an association of radio and chemotherapy.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"cancer of the cervical esophagus\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"radiation therapy\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

This report is confined to the 165 patients treated by radiation therapy (RT) only and focuses on the problem of relapse in the neck. A comparison is made between patients treated for the primary tumor with RT portals less than or equal to 30 cm2 and patients treated with larger field sizes. Sixty patients suffered a local recurrence, which was followed by a relapse in the neck in 13 patients. Nineteen patients experienced a relapse in the neck without a previous local failure. Five of these patients experienced a local failure at a later time. A multivariate analysis showed that the risk of a regional failure was significantly higher after a local failure and also for patients treated with small radiation portals (less than or equal to 30 cm2). Patients with an advanced tumor stage did not have a higher risk of a regional failure. A recurrence in the neck carried a poor survival; nearly two thirds of these patients died of their disease.

Overall survival rates were discussed in 3 groups (A, B and C), the group A was 10 of tumor free and 3 diploid tumors after irradiation, the group B was 13 of aneuploid tumors which changed to diploid ones and the group C was 4 of persistent aneuploid tumors. Each of 5 year survival rate was 100% (A), 58% (B) and 0% (C). Overall survival for C group was significantly shorter than for other groups (p &lt; 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"bladder cancer\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"radical cystectomy and pre-operative irradiation\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

The patient's age, tumour category, tumour size and haemoglobin level were shown to be independent prognostic covariates. A prognostic index was derived and four prognostic subgroups were identified. The prognostic index could divide patients within each T category into those with good, moderate, fair or poor prognosis.

Evidence for favorable survival in patients with DNA diploid tumors.\nAbstract: Stage D1 disease is found in at least every sixth patient undergoing bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy and radical retropubic prostatectomy (RRP) for clinically localized prostate cancer (PC). Previous recommendations for monotherapy using surgery, radiation, or systemic therapy alone for Stage D1 disease have usually been associated with a poor outcome in regard to progression and survival. Unlike other pathologic stages, D1 disease treated with RRP is mainly related to DNA ploidy pattern in regard to all end points (progression and survival) and immediate adjuvant hormonal treatment (AHT) rather than to the usual pathologic variables, including the number of positive nodes. Complete DNA ploidy information was available in 370 patients with Stage D1 disease (age range, 40-77 years; mean, 64 years) undergoing RRP with or without AHT with a follow-up of up to 22 years (mean, 5 years). Overall, 80% of all DNA ploidy classes (diploid, 37%; tetraploid, 46%; and aneuploid, 17%) had AHT that highly significantly delayed progression for diploid (P less than 0.0001) more than tetraploid (P less than 0.0001) and more than aneuploid (P less than 0.0001) tumors. Significant prolongation of the disease-free interval might have improved the quality of life for tetraploid and aneuploid patients. Survival (crude and cause-specific) was significantly (P = 0.02) improved only for diploid patients who received AHT but not for tetraploid and aneuploid patients. This was due to the significantly accelerated death rate after progression in those patients with early AHT for tetraploid and aneuploid (but not diploid) tumors. Delayed (on progression only) AHT resulted in high progression rates for all DNA ploidy classes (aneuploid greater than tetraploid greater than diploid); e.g., 21 of 30 diploid patients progressed and 6 patients died from disease at a median of 31.5 months in spite of immediate hormone treatment on progression. RRP and AHT for patients with Stage D1 disease resulted in a highly significant delay in overall progression (76% at 10 years) and excellent local control, depending on DNA ploidy pattern (diploid greater than tetraploid greater than aneuploid) compared with a treatment regimen without AHT (24% overall nonprogression); only 20% of all patients with AHT are projected to die of disease at 10 years. Disease in diploid patients (37%) treated with AHT rarely progressed and those patients are unlikely to die of disease in 10 years or less; delayed (on progression) hormone treatment for diploid patients seemed ineffective. Inclusion of values for prostate specific antigen led to a higher failure rate on progression, and this is dependent on DNA ploidy class (diploid greater than tetraploid greater than aneuploid). Only patients with nondiploid tumors should be entered into prospective studies using innovative adjuvant treatment protocols to improve survival.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"prostate cancer\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"radical prostatectomy and adjuvant hormonal treatment\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

Following 40 Gy irradiation of the lower abdomen, treatment consisted of cystectomy or continued irradiation of the bladder region only. A full urological examination of the bladder established whether a patient was a responder or non-responder. The patients were divided into four groups: 27 responders treated with cystectomy and diversion; 48 responders treated with continued radiotherapy up to 65 Gy; 24 non-responders treated with cystectomy and diversion; 42 non-responders treated with continued radiotherapy up to 65 Gy. Survival and complications of treatment were compared with regard to category and grade of the tumours and sex and age of the patients. It was concluded that the responders who underwent cystectomy after 40 Gy irradiation survived longer than those who received a full course of radiotherapy. The responders had a better survival rate than non-responders, regardless of further treatment.

T1 and T2 cases represented 40% of the whole group and 40% of the patients presented clinically positive neck disease. This latter group had a significantly lower cure rate (42.8%) than the N0 patients (88.3%).

In the first half of the period (group A), external irradiation alone was used, while in the second half (group B), intracavitary irradiation with a low dose-rate was applied in combination with external irradiation. The two-year local control rate was 56.9% in group A and 81.5% in group B. With the combined use of intracavitary irradiation, the five-year actuarial survival rate was also improved from 45.5% in group A to 59.7% in group B. At the same time, the frequency of late injury of the rectum, sigmoid colon and the urinary bladder was also decreased with the use of small sources.

This finding contributed to the early adoption of radiotherapy in favor of palliative treatment. Alterations of the CEA concentration during therapy could be used for monitoring the efficiency of treatment. Increasing CEA levels always signaled disease progression, decreasing CEA levels were found to be associated with improvement. In the posttreatment follow-up, increasing CEA levels were always reliable predictors of recurrent disease.

The present prospective study was to determine the influence of previous radiotherapy, widely used in the management of this tumour, on the accuracy of endosonography. A complete endosonographic examination was performed just before surgery in 40 patients with rectal cancer. Endosonographic and pathological staging were compared in group A, 21 patients without previous radiotherapy, and group B, 19 patients with preoperative radiotherapy. While the endosonographic accuracy for lymph node involvement was similar in the two groups (85 per cent compared with 84 per cent), wall invasion was correctly ascertained in 86 per cent in group A but in only 47 per cent in group B (P less than 0.05). After irradiation, the thickening of the rectal wall and the poor visualization of the hyperechoic layers hampered interpretation. Post-radiotherapy inflammation and/or fibrosis probably explained the echographic changes. Radiotherapy therefore altered endosonographic staging of rectal cancer.

Thirteen infants were admitted within 30 hours of delivery, and the remainder at 2 to 3 weeks of age. Infants were rewarmed under a radiant warmer. The mean time required to reach a rectal temperature of 36.5 degrees C was 3.96 +/- 2.37 hours. Major medical entities encountered included thrombocytopenia (eight patients), metabolic acidosis (eight), respiratory distress (eight), renal failure (six), apnea (four), patent ductus arteriosus (four), seizures (four), intracranial hemorrhage (three), infection (three), and necrotizing enterocolitis (two). No complications could be attributed to the rapid rewarming technique. Of three infants who died, all weighed less than 1.25 kg at birth.

All eight patients demonstrated a continuous rise in the absolute number of neutrophils, eosinophils, and monocytes over the first four weeks of therapy. Bone marrow examination revealed a progressive increase in bone marrow cellularity in all patients except one. An increase in myeloid: erythroid ratio was seen with progressive maturation of granulocytic cells. Neutrophilic and eosinophilic myelocytes were the most prominent cells. The percentage of myeloblasts and promyelocytes did not increase significantly, and the proportions of postmitotic granulocytic cells did not change either. No significant morphologic changes were noted in the basophilic, erythroid, and megakaryocytic series. The most prominent topographic observation in the bone marrow during GM-CSF therapy was the frequent clustering of myeloid cells close to the bone trabeculae. The periosteal localization of myeloid precursors may reflect a higher concentration of stem cells and/or stromal cells in the bone marrow adjacent to the bone trabeculae or a higher concentration of growth factors. Careful morphologic examination of bone marrow in CSF clinical trials will provide useful information regarding the in vivo effects of these growth factors, and will aid in the development of a rational approach to combining them for therapy.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"refractory aplastic anemia\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"recombinant granulocyte macrophage-colony-stimulating factor\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [\"bone marrow examination\"], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

Apropos of 2 cases treated by direct reconstruction.\nAbstract: The authors present two cases of hepatic echinococcus cyst with destruction of the biliary confluent. The severity of this exceptional lesion requires uncommon treatment. Experience with treatment of biliary fistulas when there is a residual cystic cavity, provides arguments for and against primary suture of these fistulas. In these cases, the required treatment consists in reconstruction of the hepatic biliary ducts destroyed (right, left and common) by using the pericystic envelope itself as a plastic neoformative element. The result has demonstrated its efficacy after many years of use, as we have indicated in this article. \"Echinococcus granulosus\" itself is only rarely a problem in the host, but a hepatic echinococcus cyst does not only pose a spatial problem, except insofar as it often involves the biliary tree. In the cases reported here, the hepatic echinococcus cyst causes biliary problems in over 60% of the cases (1). These biliary problems were as follows: Compression of the common bile duct by the cys; More often, compression of the intrahepatic bile ducts causes the cyst to open inside the biliary duct and to fissure, leading to a biliocystic fistula.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"hepatic hydatid cyst\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"reconstruction\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

In fact, while the air released by the alveolar baro-trauma can, once a given pressure is exceeded, migrate into the retroperitoneum and produce a non-surgical pneumascos (for which the other possible causes are far more exceptional, and rather are unpleasant surprises, such as this orogenital induced PPT in Gantt's female patient, conversely the pressurized air from true ruptures of intraabdominal hollow organs may migrate into the mediastinum and cause a thoracic air leakage syndrome that perfectly simulates this pulmonary baro-trauma. Therefore all the paraclinical means required must be used to confirm--or rule out--this diagnosis of perforation, which demands emergency surgery. However, if there is any doubt, the consensus is that emergency surgery is recommended as it is better to accept blank laparotomy than to oversee a gastrointestinal rupture with all its severe complications of evolution.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"severe blunt injuries\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"respiratory or cardiorespiratory resuscitation\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

One patient died after operation from myocardial infarction; and one patient went abroad. The healing course of the remaining 97 fractures is described, classified according to the type of fracture and the accuracy of operative reduction. Seventy-five fractures had a normal time to union, defined as the lasting achievement of full weight-bearing within 4 months. In 7 fractures the healing period was moderately delayed (full weight-bearing being achieved in 4-6 months) and in 5 it was seriously delayed, requiring 6-11 months after injury. Nonunion occurred in 4 cases and refracture in 6 cases. Osteitis developed in 2 cases and was successfully treated with antibiotics within 6 weeks. A second internal fixation was necessary in 12 patients. In 5 patients a plaster cast was applied to treat delayed union. Amputation was necessary in a 75-year-old man with senile dementia who developed infection after a second operation for refracture. One patient still has a pseudarthrosis after 2 years and 2 further operations. In the other 95 fractures union was the end-result.

Salt restriction has reduced the diastolic blood-pressure by 7.3+/-1.6 mm Hg, a result similar to that in patients treated with antihypertensive drugs.

All the patients were followed up for 10 to 19 years (average 15 years) after operation. The results were evaluated both clinically and radiographically (according to the Severin and MacFarland methods). The data were later submitted to computer analysis, using a semiautomatic aquisition programme which allowed for evaluation of the geometry of the hip. The most important parameters for evaluation of the results were the Wiberg CE angle, the acetabular angle, the minimum joint space, and the horizontal component of the resultant force. Clinically and radiographically there was an 80% success rate according to Severin's method of evaluation. There was also good correlation with the computerized analysis.

In Japan it has long been common knowledge that the ingestion of green tea should be avoided before and after the intake of iron preparations. There have recently been some reports, however, that deny the effect of green tea on iron preparations. A study was conducted on pregnant patients with anemia, using sodium ferrous citrate (Ferromia). The drug was administered to a group of patients taking green tea and a group taking water. Our results can be summarized as follows. 1. Hemoglobin, serum iron and total iron binding capacity were markedly improved after the administration of the iron preparation, and there was no difference between these parameters in the two groups of patients. 2. There was a tendency for patients with hypochromia to show a more marked improvement in hemoglobin in both groups. 3. Anemia cured in 96.7% of patients in the green tea group and in 93.4% of patients in the water group after the oral administration of the iron preparation. 4. The incidence of side effects stood at 18.3% for the green tea group and 21.9% for the water group, there being no significant difference.

The most common late postoperative sequelae were inverted areolae and hypaesthesiae of the areolar region. When operation was carried out, half of the patients were overweight. The remainder were of normal weight. Among the patients, who were overweight time of operation, 2/3 found that the cosmetic correction was unsatisfactory. In the \"normal weight group\" 2/3 were satisfied with the cosmetic result. The patients in the dissatisfied group found that too little tissue had been removed from the area. The operation is carried out through a little infraareolar incision. Because of this, it is technically difficult, especially in patients with considerable subcutaneous tissue. On this background, we find that Webster's method alone, not should be used as surgical treatment of gynecomastia in overweight patients.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"gynecomastia\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"subcutaneous mastectomy using Webster's method\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

Four patients died 5--24 months after primary operation. In seven patients (50%), the tumor recurred locally. Surgery for recurrent tumor was beneficial.

Case report.\nAbstract: The authors report a case in which an enlarging skull fracture was surgically repaired on the fourth day after the initial injury. A 5-month-old boy fell from his father's arms and was hospitalized with a large, irregular protrusion in the left parieto-occipital region and right hemiparesis. Plain skull films showed a diastatic linear fracture with a maximum width of 8 mm, which expanded to 11 mm by the fourth day. Computed tomography (CT) scans revealed a cerebral contusion just beneath the fracture as well as a left subdural effusion. At operation, the contused brain tissue was found to have herniated over the bone defect. Craniotomy revealed a large dural defect, which was repaired with lyophilized dura. The patient was discharged with no neurological deficit. On the basis of a review of 58 recently reported cases of skull fracture, the authors conclude that the following conditions warrant consideration of early surgery: 1) a diastatic skull fracture with a width of at least 4 mm; 2) CT demonstration of a cerebral contusion beneath the fracture; 3) overlying scalp swelling; and 4) a neurological abnormality contralateral to the fracture. Performing surgery before the fracture gap becomes scalloped will result in more rapid neurological recovery and reduce the likelihood of enlargement of the fracture.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"skull fracture\", \"Symptoms\": [\"irregular protrusion in the left parieto-occipital region\", \"right hemiparesis\"], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"surgery\", \"CureRate\": \"1.0\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [\"computed tomography (CT)\"], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

The presence of thyroid cancer was found in 11 patients for a total incidence of 6.1%. Six patients had TDG (percent incidence in this group 6.9%), 4 patients had TNG (7.5%) and 1 had TA (2.5%). While the presence of thyroid cancer was totally unsuspected in TNG and TA, in TDG 4 out of 6 patients found to have a cancer, had been suspected before surgery. When a thyroid nodule was present in a toxic diffuse goiter the possibility to face with a malignant lesion reached 22.2% of the cases (4 out of 18 cases), while only 2 out of 68 patients (2.9%) with TDG and no nodule had thyroid cancer.

Comprehensive analyses of blood and urinary steroids showed that although the steroid profiles differed between patients, the pattern in each patient remained almost constant as the disease progressed, or remitted due to therapy. Elevations of serum testosterone and oestradiol were commensurate with the extent of virilisation, and the urinary output of aldosterone was associated with the severity of hypertension. A new finding was that all had substantially increased urinary free deoxycorticosterone. Complete surgical removal of the primary tumours was impossible but when most of the tumour tissue was removed, full clinical and biochemical remissions were obtained for a short time in 2 patients. One patient obtained a clinical and biochemical remission from op'DDD. In another patient the drug caused reduction both in blood pressure and in urinary aldosterone excretion, but there were unpleasant side effects. A third patient could not tolerate op'DDD. Metyrapone therapy produced neither clinical nor biochemical improvement in 3 patients. The mean duration of survival was 17 months after the first symptoms and 10 months from the date of operation. Despite advances in drug therapy, adrenal cortical carcinoma remains a lethal disease. Biochemical screening of multiple steroids offers a means of early diagnosis and disease monitoring.

Analysis of 40 patients treated by the same surgeon.\nAbstract: Forty patients with acute ruptures of the Achilles tendon were treated surgically by the same physician (T.B.Q.) during a period of 1947 to 1971. The average followup was 19 years. Ninety percent of the patients were men (average age 37.5 years) who were engaged in recreational sport activities. The majority denied a physical conditioning program. The acute ruptures were treated by a surgical procedure which consisted of a 15-cm incision on the medial aspect of the tendon with either the plantaris muscle being woven through the Achilles tendon in a clockwise fashion or a pull-out wire, supplemented with silk mattress sutures, being used to repair the ruptured tendon. The wound was closed and the patient's leg was immobilized. The wire was removed at 6 weeks. The rehabilitation plan consisted of ambulation with a heel lift and elastic stocking (the height of the lift was gradually reduced) and toe exercises. The patients began walking downstairs backwards at 3 months and continued exercises until full range of motion was attained. Subjectively, the results were excellent as graded by the patients. Objectively, there were some minor deficits but they did not impede the overall function. On a scale of 1 (poor) to 4 (excellent), the clinical results were rated excellent (42%), good (36%), fair (15%), and poor (6%).

A simple gross excision of the tumor provides the best cosmetic result, but a wide local resection may be important to prevent local recurrence in some patients. In order to identify patients who are not adequately treated by gross excision of the tumor and radiation therapy, we performed a retrospective clinical-pathologic review of 221 treated women with infiltrating duct carcinoma. There were 53 cases in which the excision specimen showed a constellation of three pathologic features: prominent intraductal carcinoma in the tumor, intraductal carcinoma in the grossly-normal adjacent tissue, and poorly-differentiated nuclei. These cases had a 37% risk of a local recurrence at 6 years compared to eight per cent for all other cases (p less than 0.0001). In cases with all three features, the use of a supplemental dose of radiation to the primary site did not significantly reduce the risk of a local recurrence. Local recurrence at 6 years was 34% in cases with all three features, who received supplemental local radiation, compared to 49% in cases not receiving a supplemental dose (p = 0.28). Survival was also worse for patients with all three features compared to other cases (69% vs. 90% at 6 years, p = 0.002). These results indicate that patients with all three pathologic features have a high risk of local recurrence following gross excision of the tumor and radiation therapy. If primary radiation therapy is selected for these patients, they should first undergo a re-excision of the tumor site in order to be certain that areas of extensive intraductal carcinoma have been adequately resected. Patients whose tumors do not show all three features are adequately treated by gross excision of the tumor prior to radiation therapy.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"breast cancer\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"surgical resection\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

Of the 150 patients, 103 suffered from pleomorphic rhabdomyosarcomas, 40 patients had embryonal rhabdomyosarcomas, and 7 had alveolar cell type of rhabdomyosarcoma. The males suffered almost twice as much as the females from this form of cancer (96 males to 54 females). The fifth decade had the highest incidence of all rhabdomyosarcomas. The younger patients generally suffered from embryonal rhabdomyosarcomas and the older ones from pleomorphic rhabdomyosarcomas, although age was no barrier to the occurrence of embryonal rhabdomyosarcomas in some of the older patients and pleomorphic rhabdomyosarcomas in some of the younger patients. Caucasians were almost exclusively afflicted by this form of cancer (93% of this series). The lower extremity was the most frequent site of the lesion, occurring in 50.7% of the 150 cases. The upper extremity was the second most frequently involved site (28%), and the trunk was the least involved site (21.3%). Of the 150 patients studied, 40 were considered indeterminate. Thirteen patients are alive and free of cancer, but were treated less than 5 years ago; 12 patients reported for consultation only. There were 13 who were free of sarcomas at periods in excess of 2 years but were lost to follow-up. Two patients in this series died before the 5-year period, and autopsy revealed the death to be due to causes other than the rhabdomyosarcoma. Of the 110 determinate patients, 75 (68%) died as a result of the cancer. The 5-year survival rate equals 32%. The fact of the 30% 5-year survival after treatment for recurrences should help dismiss the pessimism which prevails once a recurrence is noted subsequent to major therapy. Age per se had no great effect on prognosis. The poorest results occurred in the 11-20 age range, with a 5-year survival of 15%. This value reflects on increased incidence of embryonal rhabdomyosarcomas which tend to be more malignant and metastasize earlier than do the pleomorphic type. The effect of location upon survival revealed that of 76 patients with involvement of the lower extremity, 34% survived 5 years or longer, and those with sarcomas of the trunk had the poorest survival (26%). The fact that the trunk, by virtue of its anatomy, limits the degree of surgery that can be perfomred, probably helps to explain this difference. The role of radiation therapy and chemotherapy awaits elucidation. Reports of combined surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy are encouraging.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"rhabdomyosarcoma of the extremities and trunk\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"surgical resection\", \"CureRate\": \"0.32\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

A histological examination of the abdominal tumor indicated proliferation of undifferentiated lymphoblasts with intermingled histiocytes so called \"starry sky appearance\". The diagnosis was Burkitt's lymphoma. On the 4th post-operative day, a cardiac tamponade became evident. The pericardial effusion contained many lymphoblasts and the diagnosis was pericarditis due to the invasion of lymphoma cells. The pericarditis was successfully treated by infusion of doxycycline into the pericardial space following drainage. The patient responded to systemic chemotherapy with complete remission. 7 courses of systemic chemotherapy along with intrathecal infusions for CNS prophylaxis were subsequently carried out. A state of complete remission has continued for more than 13 months. Cardiac tamponade accompanied by Burkitt's lymphoma is quite rare and has not ever been reported in Japan in our knowledge.

The present study verifies the value of negative predischarge exercise testing in identifying low-risk patients treated with thrombolysis after AMI. One hundred fifty-seven consecutive patients with an uncomplicated clinical course underwent maximal or symptom-limited exercise testing (Bruce treadmill protocol) within 15 days of AMI in the absence of therapy. The location of the AMI was anterior in 51 patients, inferior in 85 and non-Q-wave in 21. All of the patients were followed for 6 months. Death and nonfatal reinfarction were considered as major coronary events, and the recurrence of angina as a minor event. Exercise test results were negative in 105 patients (group 1) and positive for angina or ST depression greater than or equal to 0.1 mV in 52 (group 2). No deaths occurred during follow-up; there were 3 reinfarctions (3%) and 7 cases (7%) of postinfarction angina in group 1, and 2 reinfarctions (4%) and 21 cases (40%) of postinfarction angina in group 2. By the end of follow-up, 90% of the patients with negative exercise test results were event-free (97% in the case of major events).

Thirty patients with 33 chronic plantar ulcers were treated by applying total contact walking casts. Results demonstrate that 27 of 33 ulcers (81.8%) healed in an average time of 43.6 days. Healing times of patients with severe peripheral vascular disease secondary to diabetes mellitus are similar to those of patients without evidence of vascular disease. These results indicate that TCC is an effective and rapid treatment for chronic plantar ulcers in patients with or without vascular compromise secondary to diabetes mellitus.

The authors describe a patient with optic nerve infiltration by acute promyelocytic leukemia documented ophthalmoscopically and confirmed by standardized echography and magnetic resonance imaging. High-resolution chromosome banding revealed the patient had a 15;17 chromosomal translocation known to be associated with acute promyelocytic leukemia. Treatment was instituted with oral all trans-retinoic acid without adjuvant radiotherapy or intrathecal chemotherapy. Results of serial bone marrow examination showed progressive differentiation of malignant cells with complete bone marrow remission. Results of serial ophthalmic examinations showed complete resolution of the leukemic optic nerve head infiltration. All trans-retinoic acid alone can be an effective treatment for optic nerve head infiltration in acute promyelocytic leukemia.

Excessively elevated plasma ACTH concentrations and radiological evidence of sella turcica deformation led to the diagnosis of ACTH-producing adenomas and prompted their removal by transsphenoidal microsurgery. In one patient, a large Crooke's cell adenoma with extensive extrasellar expansion had caused severe and irreversible bilateral defects of the visual fields and unilateral optic atrophy. Surgical removal of the tumour and radiotherapy brought about a permanent disappearance of the hyperpigmentation, but eventually led to secondary hypothyroidism. In the second patients, the selective removal of a small intrasellar eosinophilic adenoma consisting of ACTH-producing cells did not alleviate the hyperpigmentation and did not lower the plasma ACTH concentration. However, hyperpigmentation regressed markedly within a year of treatment with a higher dose of cortisone. The rarity of similar cases in the literature seems to indicate that insufficient feedback suppression of ACTH-producing cells in treated Addison's disease does not by itself induce the development of a pituitary adenoma, but might promote the growth of an independently and coincidentally occurring microadenoma, which would have caused Cushing's disease in a person with intact adrenal glands.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"addison's disease\", \"Symptoms\": [\"progressive hyperpigmentation\", \"bilateral defects of the visual fields\", \"unilateral optic atrophy\", \"secondary hypothyroidism\"], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"transsphenoidal microsurgery\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [\"plasma ACTH concentrations,radiological evidence of sella turcica deformation\"], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

Thyroid hormone was replaced in the form of triiodothyronine given orally in doses of 20-40 microng/day. There was an improvement in body temperature within six hours of the first dose; this was accompanied by a brisk fall in serum CPK and cholesterol with a rapid rise of plasma T3 into the euthyroid range. There was a defect in water excretion which was rapidly reversed as renal function returned to normal.

Trilostane afforded reduction of plasma levels of aldosterone, progesterone, deoxycorticosterone, 17-OH progesterone, cortisol, delta 4-androstenedione, and urinary excretion of 17-hydroxycorticosteroid. Conversely, circulating levels of dehydroepiandrosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, and urinary excretion of 17-ketosteroids were increased following this drug therapy. Suppression of mineralo- or glucocorticoid biosynthesis was accompanied by an increase in plasma renin activity.

He had been diagnosed as having ventricular septal defect (VSD) at the age of 6 years. When he was hospitalized, he was in a condition of class IV by NYHA classification, with a white blood cell count of 17,300/mm3, an increase in CRP, a red blood cell sedimentation rate of 108 mm/hr, and positive alpha-streptococcus in blood culture. His cardiothoracic ratio was 64% with signs of pulmonary congestion on a chest X-ray film. Echocardiography revealed the presence of VSD and huge vegetations on the tricuspid, mitral and aortic valves. He was considered to have active infective endocarditis (AIE) which had presumably been provoked by VSD and the tooth removal. Penicillin G at a daily dose of 20 million units and gentamicin at a daily dose of 80 mg were intravenously administered to treat the alpha-streptococcus infection for about 4 weeks. Furosemide was used for congestive heart failure. Since, although his cardiac function appeared to have been improved, the signs and symptoms of the infection persisted, triple valve replacement for the tricuspid, mitral and aortic valves and patch closure of the VSD were performed 4 weeks after the hospitalization. The operation revealed inflammatory lesions extending from the endocardium of the right ventricle to the mitral valves through the VSD, and huge vegetations on the tricuspid, mitral and aortic valves. The operation was successful and the inflammatory areas gradually disappeared.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"ventricular septal defect associated with active infective endocarditis\", \"Symptoms\": [\"breathlessness\", \"continuous fever\"], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"triple valve replacement, ventricular septal defect patch closure\", \"CureRate\": \"1.0\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [\"white blood cell count,CRP,red blood cell sedimentation rate,chest X-ray film,echocardiography\"], \"Causes\": \"ventricular septal defect (VSD)\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"ventricular septal defect diagnosed at 6 years old\"}]}"}]}

In a series of 15 consecutive patients with large cerebellopontine angle tumors, all of which were more than 2.5 cm in diameter, tumor excision was performed by a one-stage combined middle fossa-translabyrinthine approach. There were 13 acoustic neuromas, 10 of which were more than 4 cm in diameter, one petrous apex meningioma 4 cm in diameter, and one facial neuroma 3 cm in diameter. The tumors were totally removed in all 15 patients. The facial nerve was preserved in 12 of 13 evaluable patients. In the 14th patient the nerve had been transected in a previous suboccipital procedure with incomplete removal, and in the 15th patient the nerve was sutured following excision of a facial neuroma. Thus, the nerve was lost at surgery in only one patient. This combined approach provided very clear visualization of the cerebellopontine angle, including the brain stem and the lower cranial nerves. It enabled identification of both the origin of the facial nerve at the brain stem and the lateral segment of the nerve in the internal auditory canal. Anterior extensions of tumor growing through the tentorial hiatus were easily removed. The results in these 15 patients show that this approach is excellent for total removal of large acoustic neuromas with preservation of the facial nerve. It is especially suitable for large tumors with anterior extensions.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"large acoustic neuromas\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"tumor excision\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

Three of the 27 patients (11%) who were asymptomatic at the outset continued to have symptoms. The nature of the CSH was well-defined in 25 patients; 19 of the 20 cases of cardio-inhibitory CSH and 4 of the 5 cases of mixed CSH were asymptomatic. These two poor clinical results were analysed: the patient with the cardio-inhibitory CSH (one recurrence in 84 months) had a drop of 40 mmHg in systolic blood pressure which fulfilled criteria of the cardio-inhibitory form of CSH (a drop of 30 to 50 mmHg). The second case was a complete therapeutic failure with 3 recurrent syncopal episodes. The patient had a mixed form of CSH (B.P. drop of 65 mmHg) associated with a \"pace maker syndrome\" (drop of 50 mmHg in systolic blood pressure at the onset of VVI pacing without any sino carotid massage).

Single nail fixation is a safe reliable procedure and there appears to be little indication for multiple fixation or compression devices for this fracture.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"undisplaced fracture of the neck of the femur\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"Watson-Jones nail fixation\", \"CureRate\": \"0.944\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

CT measurement showed that perirectal fascia tend to increase in thickness during preoperative radiotherapy in proportion to tumor extension into perirectal fat tissue. The fascial thickening more than 7 mm after preoperative radiotherapy was suggestive of local recurrence to develop.

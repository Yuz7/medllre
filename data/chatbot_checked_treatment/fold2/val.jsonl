The mean duration of respiratory symptoms was 17 months. In 66 adults, asthma was the most frequent indication for surgery. The mean duration of respiratory symptoms was 9.7 years. Suppression of reflux was obtained by operation in 95% of infants and children, with disappearance of respiratory disorders in 78.6% and clinical improvement of symptoms in 16.4%. Suppression of reflux was confirmed in 94% of adults, with disappearance of respiratory disorders in 36% and improvement of symptoms in 28%. The correlation between disappearance of reflux after surgery and cure of respiratory disorders in infants and children must be seen in the light of the natural history of lower oesophageal sphincter maturation.

To determine whether iron overload leads to insulin resistance before the development of insulin deficiency, insulin was infused (by euglycemic insulin-clamp technique) into 12 children with thalassemia (4 of whom were prepubertal, and 8 pubertal) who had normal or only moderately impaired glucose tolerance and who were receiving chelation therapy. Although insulin-stimulated glucose metabolism in the prepubertal children with thalassemia was similar to that in controls (normal prepubertal children) (319 +/- 23 vs. 314 +/- 41 mg per square meter of body-surface area per minute, P not significant), the response to insulin was markedly impaired in the pubertal children with thalassemia (155 +/- 18 vs. 224 +/- 15 mg per square meter per minute in normal pubertal controls, P less than 0.01). Plasma insulin levels rose excessively after oral glucose administration in the pubertal subjects with thalassemia, but not in the prepubertal patients (P less than 0.001). Furthermore, in response to a standard hyperglycemic stimulus, insulin levels in the pubertal patients rose to two to three times greater than normal and C-peptide levels became significantly elevated.

Of the total number, 21% had an excellent response to treatment, becoming completely free from asthma and requiring no drug therapy. A further 33% had a good response, with worthwhile decrease in frequency and severity of the attacks of asthma, or a decrease in drug requirements. About half of the 46% who had a poor response had a marked subjective improvement in general well-being. Statistical evaluation of the six variables (age, sex, result, trance depth, psychological factors and severity of the asthma) confirmed the clinical impression that the ability to go into a deep trance (closely associated with the youthfulness of the subject) gives the best possibility of improvement, especially if there are significant aetiological psychological factors present and the asthma is not severe.

There were no significant differences in either the follicular phase or luteal phase hormonal profiles of estradiol and progesterone, but there was a significantly reduced pregnancy rate in those women with severe endometriosis. In part, this was due to the recovery of fewer oocytes from the endometriosis patients (P less than 0.001) despite the fact that the peak estradiol levels and ovarian accessibility were similar in the two groups. However, there were no significant differences in the proportion of oocytes that fertilized or the number that demonstrated normal embryo growth and high-grade embryo quality.

Four cases are described in which holding a retarded, ruminating child for 10-15 min before, during, and after meals, was associated with remission of rumination. Simple holding was effective in three; in the fourth, it was necessary to punish the child by putting her into a separate room for 3 min immediately after regurgitation. A within-subject reversal experimental design suggested that holding and not simple distraction was the effective component of the treatment. Treatment benefits were well maintained when the child returned to a home environment in which he or she continued to be held periodically. It is proposed that there are two behavioral etiologies for idiopathic rumination syndrome--social deprivation and reward learning through increased attention for regurgitation. Holding is the treatment of choice for the first type, and punishment with time out may be necessary to suppress regurgitation in the second type.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"rumination syndrome\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"increased holding\", \"CureRate\": \"0.75\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

These complexes have been used to treat Dpt-hypersensitive patients who suffered from chronic bronchial asthma. Clinical symptoms and medication intake were followed by filling in diary cards. Peak expiratory flow, measured four times a day, was also followed. Intradermal skin tests and bronchial challenge tests were performed with allergen together with an evaluation of nonspecific bronchial reactivity. Specific IgE and IgG antibodies were assayed after separation from the bulk of serum immunoglobulins by immunoadsorption. The study was carried out over two years according to a double-blind protocol. Intradermal inoculation of antigen-antibody complexes resulted in a marked reduction of both clinical and medication scores. No systemic side-effects were observed and only mild wheal and flare reactions were noted at the injection site. The treatment showed a drastic reduction of specific skin and bronchial reactivities with only marginal effects on nonspecific bronchial reactivity. Concentrations of specific IgE antibodies decreased significantly during the first weeks of treatment and remained at these lower values throughout the study. Specific IgG antibodies actually decreased in the majority of treated patients. The total amount of allergen used in this study was less than 1% of the amount currently used for conventional hyposensitization with the same allergen. These findings show that antigen-antibody complex inoculation is an efficient and safe means of treating allergic bronchial asthma and that the mechanism of action is likely to differ from conventional hyposensitization.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"allergic bronchial asthma\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"inoculation of allergen-antibody complexes\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

Median age was 54, and M/F 1.3. At diagnosis, 26 patients had refractory anaemia with an excess of blasts in transformation (RAEB-T) three had refractory anaemia (RA), 11 had refractory anaemia with excessive blasts (RAEB) and seven had chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML). Treatment was started within 3 months of diagnosis in 30 patients, and after more than 3 months in the 17 remaining patients. At the onset of treatment, 16 patients had progressed to acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Twenty-two patients (47%) reached complete remission (CR), 10 (21%) had hypoplastic death and 15 (32%) had resistant disease. Median actuarial disease-free interval was 11 months. Median actuarial survival was 14 months from diagnosis and 10 months from the onset of treatment. A significantly higher CR rate was found in patients with RAEB-T at diagnosis (69% v 19% in patients with other FAB subtypes: P = 0.008), and in patients treated within 3 months of diagnosis. Using multivariate analysis, RAEB-T at diagnosis emerged as the most powerful prognostic factor of CR achievement. Karyotype was the only significant prognostic factor of disease-free interval, with a median of 16.5 months in patients with normal karyotype versus 4 months in patients with normal findings (P = 0.018). A subgroup of 15 patients with RAEB-T at diagnosis and normal karyotype, who had a CR rate of 80% and a median actuarial disease-free interval of 18 months, could be identified. Our results confirm that, overall, intensive chemotherapy has limited efficacy in MDS, especially when compared with allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Relatively favourable results were obtained in our patients with RAEB-T at diagnosis, however, particularly those with normal karyotype. In that subgroup, intensive chemotherapy may be recommended, especially before BMT, as a high risk of relapse after BMT in patients with RAEB-T allografted as first line therapy has been reported.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"myelodysplastic syndromes\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"intensive chemotherapy\", \"CureRate\": \"0.47\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

The patient was successfully treated with interferon-alpha (IF-alpha). In the fifth year of treatment with IF-alpha the morphology of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and of bone marrow infiltration changed with the appearance of numerous small to intermediate shaped lymphocytes of a T-helper phenotype.

He was treated with intraarterial infusion of CDDP, Etoposide, 5-FU, through a catheter placed in the proper hepatic artery. CDDP (30 mg/day) and Etoposide (60 mg/day) were given once every 5 days, and then 5-FU(250 mg/day) was infused daily for 26 days. The patient underwent this protocol study twice in 3 months. After the intraarterial infusion, transarterial embolization using CDDP (100 mg) powder added to lipiodol and aluminum stearate as suspension was done a month later. The tumor regression rate was 84% after intraarterial infusion of CDDP, Etoposide and 5-FU. The tumor thrombus in the intrahepatic portal vein and IVC had completely disappeared. We could not find lipiodol accumulated in the tumor after TAE. Thus, we assumed that the remaining tumor was a necrotic scar and that a complete response was obtained in the patient.

ADR at a dose of 20 mg and MMC at 10 mg were administered through the hepatic artery or peripheral vein during hemodialysis. ADR and MMC became undetectable after 24 hours and 2 hours, respectively. On the other hand, while MMC was detected in dialysate, but ADR was not. Consequently, it was speculated smaller molecular weight of MMC (334.34) than that of ADR (579.99) might be responsible for the appearance of MMC in dialysate.

The infection rate was 0.4 per cent, and the nonunion rate was 0.8 per cent. Shortening of more than 2 cm. was seen in seven cases (3 per cent), and malrotation of more than 20 degrees was noted in four cases (1.7 per cent). These more common problems of shortening and rotation were almost eliminated by the increased use of cerclage wire and postoperative traction and spica casts. Knee range of motion averaged 128 degrees. These fractures provide interesting and difficult challenges. Intramedullary nailing of the segmental fractures is technically demanding but offers excellent results in these otherwise difficult fractures. Patients with grade I and grade II comminuted fractures do well with intramedullary nailing and the bones remain stable. Grade III and grade IV comminuted fractures are unstable and pose the risk of shortening and rotation. Therefore, to gain anatomic restoration in a young person we believe that it is reasonable to perform an open reduction and cerclage wiring of these fractures. The postoperative treatment of the comminuted femoral fracture is determined by both fracture stability and patient reliability, and frequent roentgenograms are indicated.

Group 1 (age: 50.33 +/- 8.64 years) received 100 ml of 5% mannitol solution i.v.; group 2 (age: 49.80 +/- 11.11 years) 100 ml of a mannitol solution containing 7.5 mg/kg L-tryptophan; and group 3 (age: 53.46 +/- 9.60 years) 100 ml of a mannitol solution containing 15 mg/kg L-tryptophan. Vital capacity (preoperative VC) was measured before surgery. Anesthesia used was isoflurane. Narcotics or neuroleptics were not used. Pain was assessed before treatment (T-0 min), at the end of administration (T-30) and at T-60, 120, 180, 240, 300 and 360 min by the following variables: respiratory rate (RR), heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP), Scott-Huskisson test (VAS), pain vital capacity (PVC), analgesic vital capacity (AVC), and respiratory restoration factor (RRF) calculated from Bromage's formula (RRF = (AVC - PVC/preoperative VC - PVC) X 100). As regards variables RR, HR, MAP and VAS, differences between the values from T-30 to T-360 and the value at T-0 were calculated. Means and S.E.M. were calculated on the obtained values and on RRF values for each group. The significance of the differences between groups was calculated using Student's t test and Bonferroni's test. Results show a significant decrease of pain in groups 2 and 3 treated with L-tryptophan, in comparison with group 1 (controls). No significant difference was observed between the treated groups, although more lasting pain relief was observed in group 3 in comparison with group 2. Intravenous L-tryptophan showed its effectiveness in the treatment of postoperative pain even when used alone. Its use may be considered for patients with renal failure, in order to strengthen pharmacological analgesia or to prevent postoperative pain by its intraoperative administration.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"postoperative pain\", \"Symptoms\": [\"postoperative pain\"], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"intravenous L-tryptophan\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"undergoes cholecystectomy\"}]}"}]}

Aspects on treatment modalities with reference to a study on patients treated by irradiation.\nAbstract: Irradiation is the most common form of treatment of tonsillar region carcinomas in Scandinavia. During recent years, encouraging results have been reported when surgery has been performed. Therefore, an effort was made to compare different treatment principles on the basis of a study on patients treated by irradiation. This retrospective study comprised 37 patients over a 20-year period. The relative 5-year survival was 33%. Most of the patients died in the next two years after diagnosis. Seventy-three percent of the patients initially had signs of regional metastasis. Hardly 20% of these were still alive after 5 years, while patients without evidence of metastasis had a 5-year survival of 50%. Neither the size, nor the histopathological features of the primary tumor seemed to affect the incidence of regional metastasis. The duration of symptoms before diagnosis, however, seemed to influence prognosis. Surgical consideration alone, or in combination with irradiation, should be made in cases with large primary tumor with regional lymph node involvement. In other cases, however, there was no evidence suggesting surgery as a better form of therapy than irradiation alone.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"tonsillar region carcinoma\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"irradiation\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

A prolonged chest pain (more than two hours) with a major electrocardiographic lesion in the posterior leads needed an urgent coronary arteriography in order to attempt a recanalization. Antecedents of arteriopathy of the lower limbs with aortobifemoral bypass required an axillary artery right side approach. A selective right coronary opacification showed complete occlusion at the junction of segments 1 and 2. An intracoronary injection of isosorbide dinitrate relieved a coronary spasm and allowed a complete visualization of the right coronary artery. This appeared to be very atherosclerotic with several severe narrowings, and a subocclusive lesion at the site of the initial occlusion. Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasties (PTCA) were performed and led to real 'restructuring' of the right coronary artery. The clinical outcome was excellent without recurrent angina pectoris. An angiographic control performed 6 months after PTCA demonstrated the persistence of the coronary recanalization and an evident improvement of the segmental contractility. This report emphasizes the role of coronary spasm in the genesis of myocardial infarction and shows that PTCA may be performed as a first approach at the acute phase of myocardial infarction; to our knowledge it is the first PTCA performed by an axillary approach at the acute stage of myocardial infarction.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"myocardial infarction\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"isosorbide dinitrate, transluminal angioplasty\", \"CureRate\": \"1.0\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [\"coronary angiography,intracoronary injection of isosorbide dinitrate\"], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

The operation was performed under general anaesthesia using the operating microscope. The pharyngeal mucosa was protected by a saline-soaked packing in the nasal pharynx. No stent was used in the postoperative period. Normal air passage was obtained in six patients, and one patient, who had co-existing adhesions through the whole nasal cavity after previous treatment by dilation, achieved a limited air passage after one laser treatment, and further attempts were postponed until he grew older. One patient did not want another try after one failure. One patient has been operated recently, and the result is uncertain. Laser-treatment of choanal atresia seems to make other methods of operation obsolete for the following reasons: The operation is easy and quick and of slight discomfort to the patient. The time of hospitalization is short, and the operation can be repeated, if a good result is not achieved in the first try.

The most efficient treatment has, until now, been dermoplasty of the nasal septum and cavity. There have been a few reports on treatment with CO2-, argon- or Nd-YAG-lasers, which have been encouraging. Ten patients with Osler's disease were treated for severe epistaxis. Three were treated with CO2-laser, two of these under general anaesthesia. Seven patients were treated with the argon laser under local anaesthesia. A variety of other sites were treated at the same time for functional or cosmetic reasons (mouth, face, fingers, rectum). Good results were obtained in eight cases. In three of the cases the observation period was more than two years. A second treatment has been necessary in three cases. Two other patients were treated recently, and it is too early to judge the results. The argon-laser is more convenient for this purpose than the CO2-laser. The method is quick and reliable and there is no need for hospitalization.

After more than 3 procedures of LDL-apheresis without drug therapy, combination therapy with LDL-apheresis and CS-514 (eptastatin), an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme (HMG-CoA) reductase, at a dose of 10 mg twice daily was started. Pre- and post-apheresis serum cholesterol levels were decreased significantly by CS-514, from 289 +/- 24 mg/dl (mean +/- SEM) to 247 +/- 25 mg/dl and from 118 +/- 7 mg/dl to 106 +/- 9 mg/dl, respectively.

In this multi-institute non-randomized study, the five-year cumulative survival rate was 70% for the former group and 49% for the latter. The prognosis was more favorable among patients who responded to preoperative chemotherapy than among those who did not. Limb-salvage surgery was feasible for most of the surgical stage IIB patients with small extraosseous tumor extensions who had responded to preoperative chemotherapy. Local tumor recurrences were seen in 15 (14%) of the 107 patients in the limb-salvage surgery group, nine of whom died of the metastasis. While limb-salvage surgery is being increasingly used in Japan, present indications show the procedure not to reduce survival rate for osteosarcoma patients. The survival rate of patients with wide-with-marginal margins was similar to that of patients with wide margins.

At least 1 cm of normal parenchyma surrounded the tumour and no microscopic invasion of resection margins was evident. The disease was staged according to our own staging system. Lobectomy was performed in 50 patients and non-anatomical resection in the remainder. The postoperative mortality rate was 5 per cent and the major morbidity rate was 11 per cent. The actuarial 5-year survival rate for patients in stages I, II and III was 42 per cent, 34 per cent and 15 per cent respectively (P less than 0.001). The overall actuarial 5-year survival rate was 30 per cent. The prognostic importance of various patient and tumour variables was evaluated by univariate analysis and then by multivariate analysis. Age of patient, site of primary, disease-free interval between treatment of primary and of hepatic metastases, preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen levels, and number of metastases, did not relate to prognosis, while sex (P = 0.024), stage of primary (P = 0.026), extent of liver involvement (P less than 0.001), distribution of metastases (P = 0.01) and type of surgery (P = 0.028) significantly affected prognosis as single factors. Multivariate analysis revealed that only the extent of liver involvement and stage of the primary tumour were independent predictors of survival. We conclude that liver resection is effective in selected patients with hepatic metastases from colorectal cancer. In resectable patients it is not yet possible to formulate a clear prognosis based on clinical factors. The extent of liver involvement and the staging system used may be significant, although not absolute, indicators of outcome.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"hepatic metastases from colorectal cancer\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"liver resection\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

These cases ranged from 24-72 years of age (average 42), 11 were males and 12 females. There were 19 primary cases and 4 postoperative cases of recurrence, and the period of their clinical courses ranged from 2 months to 23 years. Concerning the operative procedure, in 22 cases the approach was via an upper midline incision and 1 case the approach was via left thoraco-abdominal incision. Intraoperative manometry was performed to help in judging the extent of each manipulation. With the operative manipulation, the LESP is reduced to 13.0 +/- 6.0 mmHg (39% of the average preoperative value) and HPZ is elongated to 60.9 +/- 14.1 mm (155% of the average preoperative value). Moreover, post-operative manometry data resembled intra-operative data. The effectiveness of the procedure is judged on the basis of the chief complaints, esophagography, endoscopic examination, esophageal manometry and 24-hr pH monitoring. Patients are followed up at 2 weeks, 3 months and 1 year from the operation. Results showed 22 excellent cases (96.65%), 1 fair case (4.34%). These are better results than those of other reports that showed 50-60% excellent results and 30% good results (remaining slight passage disturbance). The reason for this difference is that we obtain sufficient LESP decompression effect (myotomy + submucosal layer ablation) based on intraoperative manometry. In the only case that we judged as fair (a reoperated case after Heller's operation) showed severe EGR totalling 213 min. on 24-hr pH monitoring of the esophagus in the postoperative period and was erosion also seen in the lower esophagus endoscopically. In this case, the LESP was 6.0 mmHg and its HPZ is 27.0 mm, showing a higher HPZ than the non-reflux group. Among the non-reflux group, LESP was as low as 6.0 mmHg, and this case had a remarkable long HPZ of 57.0 mm. In conclusion, even though the LESP is low, it is possible to prevent reflux if the HPZ is sufficiently long.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"esophageal achalasia\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"long myotomy + partial fundopexy + posterior fixation based on intraoperative manometry\", \"CureRate\": \"0.9665\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

Analysis of this case and the 13 other similar cases with associated Budd-Chiari syndrome and Beh&#xe7;et's syndrome found in the literature showed that hepatic veins thrombosis: a) is often due to inferior vena caval thrombosis or membranous obstruction; b) has a high spontaneous mortality rate by acute liver failure; c) remains a potential indication for porto-systemic shunt, as are other causes of Budd-Chiari syndrome.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"budd-chiari syndrome\", \"Symptoms\": [\"bleeding esophageal varices\"], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"mesoatrial shunt\", \"CureRate\": \"1.0\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

Radiating pain and weakness occurred when she tried to stand up on Dec. 25 in 1989. She was admitted to our hospital in October 1990. Physical examination showed emaciation, hypesthesia of extremities, hypesthesia over the right chest and back, impaired vibration and position sense, and hyperreflexia. Laboratory findings revealed that the erythrocyte sedimentation rate was elevated to 46mm/hr, rheumatoid factor (RF) to 83.1IU/ml and CRP to 3.7mg/dl. Her blood sugar was high and she was diagnosed as having diabetes mellitus. Cervical X ray film showed atlanto-axial subluxation. A pseudotumor around the odontoid process bulging into the spinal canal and compression of the upper cervical cord was observed by MRI. In spite of administration of bucillamine (100mg/day), the size of pseudotumor did not change. Methotrexate (MTX) at a dose of 5mg/week was started in February 1991 and the pseudotumor decreased in size with a concurrent reduction of ESR, RF and CRP. However, the high intensity lesion by T2 weighed image did not change and dysesthesia persisted. The pseudotumor was thought to be due to pannus and it was revealed that MTX was effective for reduction. The persistent dysesthesia was probably due to the degeneration of the upper cervical cord, although diabetic neuropathy may also have played a role.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"rheumatoid arthritis\", \"Symptoms\": [\"dysesthesia of extremities\", \"Radiating pain\", \"weakness\", \"emaciation\", \"hypesthesia of extremities\", \"hypesthesia over the right chest and back\", \"impaired vibration and position sense\", \"hyperreflexia\"], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"methotrexate\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"5mg/week\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [\"physical examination,cervical X-ray,magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\"], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

To determine if lesions that are likely to recur may be predicted at the time of surgery, data from 5020 patients with 7010 basal-cell carcinomas treated with Mohs' technique were reviewed. Two thousand nine hundred sixty (2960) lesions with five-year follow-up were studied (overall recurrence rate = 2.6%). Sex and age of the patients, size and location of lesions, types of previous therapy, and the number of surgical stages of microscopically controlled excision were all found to correlate significantly with recurrence rate (p less than 0.01). Multiple regression analysis was performed to determine the relative contribution of each of these variables to predictability of recurrences by a weighted scoring system. The derived model delineated the lesions into no-risk, low-, medium-, and high-risk groupings (p less than 0.000001). Lesions in the high-risk group had a recurrence rate of 10.1%, almost four times greater than the average.

In the following years the right orbicularis oris muscle and platysma were unilaterally and progressively involved in the spasms and with increasing frequency. Medical treatment with minor transquilizer was not effective. She was referred to our department at the age of 16. CT and MRI revealed no abnormality. Angiographical study revealed that the right PICA (posterior inferior cerebellar artery) was tourtously coming off from a relatively high portion of the right vertebral artery. The trunk of the right AICA (anterior inferior cerebellar artery) was not able to be identified. Although the onset of this condition was unusually early, the clinical course and symptoms of hemifacial spasm were so clearly typical that she underwent microvascular decompression surgery on July 26, 1988, at the age of 16. During the operation an upward looping PICA was found crossing and tightly compressing the exit zone of the right facial nerve. The offending artery seemed to be elastic without significant atherosclerotic change. The arterial loop was carefully dissected and replaced with two pieces of sponge prosthesis between the artery and the surface of brain stem. Her hemifacial spasm completely disappeared post-operatively. No recurrence has been noted for over one year in the follow-up observation. Hemifacial spasm is subacutely or chronically a progressive disorder of facial involuntary movement. The arterial compression in the exit zone of the facial nerve is said to be the cause of the disorder and microvascular decompression has been indicated for it since a little before the beginning of this decade.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"juvenile hemifacial spasm\", \"Symptoms\": [\"intermittent involuntary spasms of the right lower orbicularis oculi muscle\"], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"microvascular decompression surgery\", \"CureRate\": \"1.0\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [\"computed tomography (CT),magnetic resonance imaging (MRI),angiography\"], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

The cases were collected through a cooperative effort of 57 surgeons at eight hospitals in the Detroit area and coordinated by the Michigan Cancer Foundation where data collection and analyses were completed. The primary treatment of all patients was a modified radical mastectomy. Of the 1,078 cases accessioned between October 1975 and April 1983, 537 were found to have no microscopic lymph node involvement and 462 of these cases received no adjuvant antineoplastic therapy. The period of follow-up of these cases (alive, n = 358) has been 78.75 +/- 24.6 months (mean +/- SD). Overall, the cumulative 6-year recurrence rate as calculated by life table analysis was 26%, with 16.8% dying of their disease. Tumor size was an important prognostic factor; the recurrence rate was 16.2% for those with primaries measuring less than or equal to 1 cm, with only a 6.3% mortality. Patients with tumors measuring greater than 5 cm also did well: 13.7% recurrence and 13.7% mortality rates at 6 years. The premenopausal women did slightly, but not statistically significantly, better than those who were postmenopausal. The presence or absence of quantifiable estrogen receptor protein (ER) was of little predictive value as far as rates of recurrence were concerned, but patients with an ER-positive tumor survived significantly longer. In postmenopausal women, those whose tumor lacked ER (n = 112) fared poorly: 30.4% experienced a recurrence by 6 years and 28% died of their disease. Recurrence rates and death rates were also high in a small group (n = 35) of postmenopausal women with ER+ tumors exhibiting nuclear pleomorphism (nuclear grade [NG]3) (38% and 24.3%, respectively).

Each patient was operated on in a single-stage procedure by anterior discectomy, without bone fusion, for protrusions between 2 and 4 mm, and by vertebral trephination and intercorporeal iliac bone-graft fusion for protrusions larger than 4 mm.

No patient showed an improvement of four grades. During a follow-up period varying from 2 to 5 years, none of the patients showed clinical evidence of progression of myelopathy; however, 44% of patients showed definite radiological evidence of progression of cervical spondylosis.

Operation was performed eighteen months at least after injury, during which period rehabilitation was necessary to prevent atrophy of the pectoralis major and contracture in internal rotation. The strength of flexion was improved by alterations of the original Clark's operation. The whole muscle was transplanted: its humeral tendon was fixed to the coracoid process; its thoracic extremity lengthened by an aponevrotic flap from rectus anterior was pulled through a posterior anti-brachial incision, holding the arm in anteposition and the forearm in supination. A strong tension was obtained in this way. Transplantation of teres major and latissimus dorsi tendons behind the humerus was done in the same stage.

There were 10 hemispherectomies, 32 temporal lobectomies and eight operations to other areas of the brain. The median age at operation was 14 years. 29 patients were found to have mesial temporal sclerosis or sclerotic hemispheres and 17 had alien tissue and one sclerosis with heterotopia. No lesion was found in three cases. The nature of the first seizure was found to relate significantly to pathology. 30 patients had suffered an early convulsion. Between the convulsive insult and the onset of focal epilepsy there was a silent interval, the duration of which was biased by sex and side of lesion. The remaining 20 patients, of whom a highly significant number had alien tissue, had not had an early convulsion before the onset of focal epilepsy. The importance of accurate clinical histories is stressed. Clinical considerations alone predicted the pathology and laterality of the lesion in more than half the series. Regular EEG recordings and repeat scanning were found to be important investigations. Major disorders of behaviour had occurred in 44 patients. As adults, the series were free of severe psychiatric symptoms, but many required years of careful rehabilitation. 31 children had been excluded from normal schools before operation. Postoperatively, many patients continued their education in normal schools. Some required basic remedial teaching, others successfully undertook higher education and training. 49 patients benefited over-all from neurosurgical treatment. 34 had no more habitual epilepsy at all.

Review of 345 consecutive cases treated over a period of 12 years.\nAbstract: This paper reports experience with 345 patients admitted to a neurosurgical department after an aneurysm rupture. At the time of admission, patients were separated into two groups: the patients unsuitable for planned surgery and called 'unoperable'; the patients planned for surgery and called 'operable patients' (328 patients). The general management attitude consisted of deferred surgery according to the clinical status of the patients and the risk of vasospasm and ischaemia. Of these, 18 died before the day of surgery, and are called 'operable and non-operated' patients. The cause of death was vasospasm and ischaemia in 10 cases and recurrence of haemorrhage in 8 cases. 310 patients were actually operated upon. Their final outcome was: good 70%, fair 9.6%, poor 7.7%, death 12.5%.

Growth on recommended daily calorie and protein intakes had been inadequate in all 5. Fat absorption and intestinal mucosal morphology were normal in all 5. 2 children were given nutritional supplementation by nasogastric intubation, 1 received nightly oral formula supplements, and 2 were supplemented with zinc, iron, folate, and vitamin E only. Nutritional supplementation by the nasogastric route produced a rapid sustained increase in growth rate, associated with striking reductions in pain crises and infections which had previously necessitated many hospital admissions. Oral supplementation improved the clinical course but had no effect on growth rate. Mineral and vitamin supplements influenced neither the growth rate nor the clinical course.

Deformity and bone loss treated by open reduction, internal fixation, and human bone morphogenetic protein (hBMP).\nAbstract: Four patients with severely deformed nonunions of the distal end of the tibia failed to respond to standard surgical methods and were successfully treated as follows: debridement of fibrous tissue, sequestrectomy, correction of angulatory deformities, internal stabilization, and implantation of human bone morphogenetic protein (hBMP). After resection of the sequestra, all four patients had significant bone defects of the anterior tibial cortex extending to the ankle joint. The average number of failed previous surgical procedures was 5.8. The average patient age was 35.3 years. The intervals of nonunion averaged 24.8 months. In two patients, the hBMP, including other low molecular weight bone matrix noncollagenous proteins (hBMP/NCP), was implanted across the fracture site in polylactic-polyglycollic acid strips (1 X 13 cm) as an onlay graft. In one patient, the BMP was implanted in the fracture gap in absorbable gelatin (No. 5 capsules). In another patient, the BMP/NCP was also implanted in the form of a composite of cortical allogeneic bone in addition to a capsule of BMP/NCP. In all four cases, alignment was restored and the bone ends were stabilized with internal fixation. Preoperatively, the ankle joints were ankylosed and painful. Healed fractures and functional ankle joints were observed in three of four patients at an average of 4.4 months. In one patient, the fracture healed but the joint remained ankylosed. Although a randomized double-blind consecutive series of matched cases is necessary to prove the efficacy of hBMP, implants of hBMP combined with skillful surgical treatment are under investigation in the interim as an alternative to amputation.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"distal metaphyseal tibial nonunion\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"open reduction, internal fixation, and human bone morphogenetic protein\", \"CureRate\": \"0.75\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

The valvular dysfunction had included aortic, mitral and tricuspid regurgitations. He had also complicated severe hepatic dysfunction due to the cardiac constriction and the secondary tricuspid valve regurgitation. With the aid of cardiopulmonary bypass radical pericardiectomy was performed for almost all cardiac surfaces including that of both ventricles, the right atrium, and the venae cavae. After the pericardiectomy, aortic valvular replacement, mitral and tricuspid valvular annuloplasties were performed. Postoperative course was uneventful and the hemodynamic abnormalities (elevated right atrial and ventricular end diastolic pressures) as well as the depressed hepatic functions were dramatically improved postoperatively.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"chronic constrictive pericarditis with rheumatic valvular heart disease\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"operation\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"rheumatic valvular heart disease\"}]}"}]}

In patients with spontaneous bacteremia, all organisms were found to be sensitive to oral antibiotics, and a favorable response was elicited in 6 out of 7 (86 p. cent) within 3 days (mean) of treatment. In patients with spontaneous peritonitis, ascitic fluid cultures were positive in 11 cases, and organisms were sensitive to pefloxacin in 9 out of 11 cases. A favorable response was elicited in 13 out of 15 within 2 to 8 days of treatment. Fourteen patients died (64 p. cent), 3 of infection (bacteremia n = 1, peritonitis n = 2), and 11 patients of causes unrelated to infection, mainly variceal hemorrhage, hepatorenal syndrome or hepatocellular carcinoma, although the clinical symptoms of infection were controlled. One-year survival was 57 p. cent in patients with bacteremia and 33 p. cent in those with bacterial peritonitis. Oral treatment was well tolerated in all patients. We suggest that most bacteremia and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in cirrhotic patients can be treated with oral antibiotics.

Our purpose was to determine whether or not patients with a low risk of relapse can be identified at the time of the initial staging evaluation. In 30 of 82 patients (Group 1), embryonal carcinoma constituted less than 80 percent of the tumor, no vessel invasion was present, and the preorchiectomy serum AFP level was less than 80 ng/dL. No relapses occurred in this group. Fifty-two patients (Group 2) had more than 80 percent embryonal carcinoma or vessel invasion or a serum AFP level higher than 80 ng/dL. Relapse occurred in 24 (46%) of these patients. The difference in the rate of relapse between patients in Group 1 and Group 2 was statistically significant (P less than 0.00001). A separate analysis of teratoma as a predictor of nonrelapse showed that the orchiectomy specimens of 30 of the 82 patients contained more than 50 percent teratoma. Only 1 relapse occurred among 25 patients with more than 50 percent teratoma and no vessel invasion.

A tentative diagnosis of acute fatty liver of pregnancy was made, and a healthy male infant was delivered by emergency cesarean section because of fetal distress. Over the subsequent 3 days, acute progressive oliguric renal failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation, hypoglycemia requiring intravenous dextrose infusion and pancreatitis developed; her mental status progressed to stage III encephalopathy. Quantitative computed tomography estimated the liver volume to be 770 cm3. The decision to proceed with orthotopic liver transplantation was made on the basis of progressive clinical deterioration despite aggressive support and because of her small liver size.

Seven of nine women who had been resistant to treatment with clomiphene, 150 mg daily, and human chorionic gonadotropin, 6000 to 9000 IU, ovulated after electrocauterization. The remaining two women responded to stimulation with clomiphene. Pregnancy occurred in 24 of 35 subjects who were involuntarily infertile (69%), with the pregnancy rate increasing to 80% with the inclusion of the women sensitive to clomiphene. These findings support the theory that ovulation is triggered by local factors within the ovary itself.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"polycystic ovarian syndrome\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"ovarian electrocautery\", \"CureRate\": \"0.92\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}]}

Under conditions of a conventional diabetes diet (including 5-6 meals per day and a strictly planned meal intake) as well as under a \"less restricted diabetes diet\" (e.g., free choice of number, timing, and amount of carbohydrate intake) near normoglycemia could be achieved. Mean daily blood glucose levels did not change significantly when the patients' nutrition was alternated between both diets. During the \"less restricted diabetes diet,\" the patients opted for a rather high fat intake (51 +/- 5% fat, 34 +/- 5% carbohydrate, and 15 +/- 2% protein). Despite this unintended dietary behavior, serum lipids and body weight remained normal after an observation period of 4-6 mo. It is concluded that during permanent near normoglycemia achieved by CSII a partial liberalization of the diabetes diet does not introduce any short-term or long-term metabolic risk factors for cardiovascular diseases.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"type i diabetes\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}], "completion": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"type i diabetes\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}\n\n"}

Mean plasma glucose levels were near-normal during the 24 h and, in particular, constant throughout the night. In a subset of six patients overnight plasma free insulin concentrations were also constant during CSII. The majority of profiles (88%) showed a glucose nadir from 2.0 to 5.9 mmol/L (most frequently at 0600 h) and had an 0800 h value from 2.0 to 6.9 mmol/L (92%). A large proportion (46%) of profiles showed a zero or negative nadir-0800 h glycemic increase. In 22 patients with three or more profiles recorded at the same basal insulin infusion rate, only one of 103 profiles had a fasting glycemic increase greater than an arbitrary value of 5.0 mmol/L (5.3), although many patients exhibited small dawn glycemic increases (e.g., 14 of 22 had a mean increase of from 0 to 2 mmol/L). In 12 subjects a 15% reduction in basal insulin infusion rate increased the mean +/- SEM dawn glycemic increase from 0.58 +/- 0.25 mmol/L to 2.7 +/- 0.76 mmol/L (P less than 0.025) as well as significantly increasing the nocturnal nadir and 0800 h plasma glucose concentrations. Thus, a marked dawn phenomenon is rare when a single but adequate basal infusion rate is used for CSII, and this questions the need in the majority of patients for preprogrammable pumps with nocturnal infusion rate changes.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"diabetes\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}], "completion": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"diabetes\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}\n\n"}

The average ejection fraction was 29 +/- 4%, range 17 to 35%. Thirteen patients had ventricular aneurysms, 4 had grade 3 or 4 mitral regurgitation. The coronary lesions were usually multivessel left main coronary (6), triple vessel disease (27), double vessel disease (12), single vessel disease (1). The average number of bypass grafts per patient was 2.3. The average aorting clamping time was 63 minutes (range 26 to 133 minutes). There were 4 mitral valve replacements, 4 resections of ventricular aneurysms and 1 double procedure (aneurysmectomy and valve replacement). The operative mortality was 2.1% (1 death).

Two patients underwent cardiac transplantation. The regression of angina (90% of operated patients were asymptomatic) and the low operative risk, justify aortocoronary bypass surgery despite left ventricular dysfunction in patients with severe symptoms (unstable angina, chronic, invalidating angina). The medium-term results indicate a high risk of cardiac failure which is partially responsible for the secondary mortality rate of 17% at 2 years.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"severe left ventricular dysfunction\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"coronary artery bypass surgery\", \"CureRate\": \"0.5\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}], "completion": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"severe left ventricular dysfunction\", \"Symptoms\": [\"severe left ventricular dysfunction\"], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"coronary artery bypass surgery\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}\n\n"}

They are aged from 45 to 79 years old, the average 56, and aspirated 1 to 24 days after the onset, two third of them being within 1 week. The whole procedure was done in the CT room under direct CT guidance and by one trial. In putaminal type hemorrhage, the removed hematoma volumes ranged from 9 to 48 ml, average being 23.7 ml, in thalamic type from 5 to 29 ml, average being 15.5 ml. The average rate of removal was 81.1% in 30 cases within 1 week. In most cases, preoperative consciousness was not severely disturbed, in putaminal type, 19 were alert or confused, 4 somnolent, 5 stuperous and in thalamic type, 6, 6, 3 respectively and 2 were semicomatous, one of them had herniation sign. In putaminal type all but 2 cases recovered to alert or confused state, the first one had postoperative bleeding and the other was already apallic preoperatively. In thalamic type, we lost 3 cases, 2 by gastrointestinal bleeding and 1 DIC, by rehemorrhage 2 months after the operation. All but one who was semicomatous preoperatively recovered to alertness. In motor function, some cases of the putaminal bleeding with intact internal capsule remained hemiplegic. On the other hand, most of the cases with partial destruction of the internal capsule on CT recovered well in both types of hematoma.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"hypertensive intracerebral hematoma\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"CT guided stereotactic aspiration\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}], "completion": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"hypertensive intracerebral hematoma\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"stereotactic aspiration\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [\"computed tomography (CT)\"], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}\n\n"}

Patients with elevated serum bilirubin and/or amylase were included in the trial. Two patients died during conservative treatment, and in 4 cases medical treatment was interrupted because of peritonitis, and in 3 cases because of increasing jaundice. Recurrence of AC was found in 24% of the patients in the DS group. There was no mortality in the ES group, but 2 patients died postoperatively in the DS group. Wound infection developed in 3 patients in the ES, and in 8 patients in the DS group. Retained stones remained in 3 cases of the DS and in 1 case of the ES group. The operative procedures were easier to perform in the ES group than in the DS, as estimated by the duration of operation.

The patient, a 2-year-and-9-month-old female who has no history of trauma had a pulsating mass at her right retroauricular region six months after birth. On admission to our clinic she was neurologically free except the pulsating mass (2 X 3 cm) with bruit and thrill. Selective right external carotid angiography revealed a high-flow simple AVF from internal maxillary artery to jugular vein. The normal blood flow of both the external and internal carotid system was decreased. Under local anesthesia, non-detachable balloon catheter was inserted to the internal maxillary artery by the transfemoral approach and inflated at the proximal side of the orifice of AVF until the vascular murmur in the neck disappeared. The balloon catheter was then exchanged with a detachable balloon catheter (Debrun, No. 9) which was inflated by silicone (0.4 ml), and was detached successfully. Follow-up angiography 1 year after the treatment revealed no recurrence of the fistula and almost branches of external carotid artery such as middle meningeal artery, occipital artery, superficial temporal artery and facial artery were clearly seen.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"spontaneous arteriovenous fistula of the external carotid artery\", \"Symptoms\": [\"pulsating mass at right retroauricular region\", \"bruit\", \"thrill\"], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"detachable balloon method\", \"CureRate\": \"1.0\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [\"selective right external carotid angiography\"], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}], "completion": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"spontaneous arteriovenous fistula of the external carotid artery\", \"Symptoms\": [\"pulsating mass at her right retroauricular region\"], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"detachable balloon\", \"CureRate\": \"1.0\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [\"selective right external carotid angiography\"], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}\n\n"}

Annual incidence of end stage renal failure (ESRF) treated by dialysis increased of 25% when two consecutive periods of five years each were compared: A (1976-1980) 46 per 10(6) inhabitants, B (1981-1985) 62 per 10(6) inhabitants. In 1986, the progression was confirmed: 96 per 10(6). At the time of the beginning of dialysis treatment, mean age (+/- SD) was not different between two periods: 53 +/- 17 yrs (A) vs 51 +/- 17 yrs (B) but it increased in 1986: 61 +/- 14 yrs. Sex ratio (M/F) progressed from 1 (A) to 1.75 (B). The study of causes of ESRF showed a net increase of secondary renal diseases (diabetes, amyloidosis), interstitial nephropathies due to obstructive uropathy (lithiasis) and drugs. For the period B, 91% of primary glomerulonephritis reaching ESRF had had renal biopsy.

A 59-year-old man was admitted because of sudden deep coma and tetraparesis. Neurological examination on admission showed miotic pupils with absent light reaction, no oculocephalic reflex, no corneal reflex and tetraparesis. Glasgow scale was evaluated to be E-1 V-1, and M-3 with total of 5 points. Computed tomography confirmed a large hematoma in the cerebellum with ventricular rupture. Immediately, a suboccipital craniectomy was performed and the hematoma was evacuated. His neurological condition was improved gradually within a month after the operation. He responded to verbal orders and moved all his limbs against gravity. His respiration, however, was irregular with a pattern of so-called \"cluster breathing\" followed by prolonged apnea, that was more pronounced in night. He was suffered from hypoxic hypercapnea and recurrent pneumonia. Therefore, authors decided to employ diaphragm pacing for management of central alveolar hypoventilation. A diaphragm pacemaker (radiofrequency induction) was implanted. A cuff electrode was put around the right phrenic nerve in the right thorax, and the receiver installed subcutaneously in the right anterior chest. Postoperative respiratory study showed ventilation on pacing with satisfactory blood gas and he became able to move around using a wheel chair. In 1966 Glenn demonstrated a new technique to move the diaphragm paced by a receiver through the phrenic nerve, triggered by radio wave from external device.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"central alveolar hypoventilation\", \"Symptoms\": [\"sudden deep coma\", \"tetraparesis\"], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"diaphragm pacing\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [\"computed tomography (CT)\"], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}], "completion": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"central alveolar hypoventilation\", \"Symptoms\": [\"sudden deep coma\", \"tetraparesis\"], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"diaphragm pacing\", \"CureRate\": \"1.0\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [\"computed tomography\"], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}\n\n"}

Measurements were made before and at intervals during treatment, the tendinous xanthomas being measured by an echographic procedure to give data on antero-posterior and lateral diameters, thus enabling an Achilles tendon index to be defined. The results confirm the hypolipidaemic activity of bezafibrate, changes in the levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, lipids and lipoproteins (LDL, VLDL and HDL) being similar in direction and magnitude to those reported previously. A significant regression in the size of the Achilles tendon xanthomas was observed in 11 of the 13 patients, and the regression in the Achilles tendon index correlated significantly with a favourable change in the ratio HDL/LDL + VLDL.

The average mean percentage change ranged from -58 to +133% compared with untreated samples. The apolipoprotein method selected was validated by comparing their concentrations with their corresponding lipoprotein lipid or protein in normal controls and Type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) diabetic patients.

However, the only alteration in VLDL composition was a small decrease in the relative proportion of phospholipid. Apolipoprotein-B and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentrations were also raised in type II patients at diagnosis. Plasma concentrations of high density lipoprotein (HDL) nonesterified and esterified cholesterol, phospholipid, and apo-AI were lower in type II patients at diagnosis. This was largely accounted for by reduced concentrations of these components in the HDL2 subfraction, which retained a normal composition. Type II patients treated by diet alone and diet + glibenclamide exhibited similar abnormalities of plasma lipoprotein concentrations, which are associated with premature coronary disease, to the type II patients at diagnosis. However, in type II patients treated with insulin, plasma lipoprotein concentrations and composition were normal, except LDL cholesterol, which was lower than normal in insulin-treated patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"non-insulin-dependent diabetes\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"diet, sulphonylurea, and insulin\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}], "completion": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"non-insulin-dependent diabetes\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"diet, sulphonylurea, and insulin\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}\n\n"}

Since 1972, a marked improvement in survival and reduction in incidence of complications has been attributed to more rigorous control of fluid overload, hypertension, and blood sugar levels by insulin therapy and careful dietary management. A diet has been developed which combines the diet used by dialysis patients with suitable modifications for the insulin-dependent patient with diabetes. The importance of patient education is stressed in an attempt to improve patient compliance.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"diabetes\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"dietary management\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}], "completion": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"diabetes\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"hemodialysis\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}\n\n"}

But it has not been well described that the anticholinergic drug causes chronic dementia after long administration. We describe six cases of chronic dementia, which is thought to be induced by anticholinergic drug. We conducted detailed neuropsychological and neuroradiological examination in these six cases. All of them were Parkinson's disease, and had used anticholinergic drug for more than six months without any side effect, and then their initial symptom of dementia appeared, followed by chronic dementia. All cases recovered reversibly from dementia within a few weeks after stoppage of taking anticholinergic drug. And any of our cases had no possibility in the cause of chronic dementia other than the side effect of anticholinergic drug. Detailed neuropsychological examinations (WAIS, WMSR, and so on) were conducted in all cases, SPECT was in two cases, and PET was in one case, before and after stoppage of the anticholinergic drug. And in all cases, brain MRI was conducted. The indices of attention, verbal memory, visual memory, and delayed recall were significantly elevated after stoppage of drug. And both verbal IQ and performance IQ were increased after stoppage of drug, too. SPECT and PET revealed significant improvement, which showed diffuse and generalized change, not localized change.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"chronic dementia in parkinson disease\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"discontinuation of anticholinergic drugs\", \"CureRate\": \"1.0\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"long-term use of anticholinergic drugs\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}], "completion": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"chronic dementia in parkinson disease\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"anticholinergic drug\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}\n\n"}

The course of the disease deteriorated in 28% of the patients between start and finish of the study, but the result was sometimes incomplete or in some doubt. For patients receiving treatment, the annual incidence of coxarthropathy was 1 per cent. In patients with medullary involvement, indicated by spasmodic paraparesis during the initial assessment, oral disodium etidronate always had a curative effect. In patients with cranial involvement, the condition worsened fairly frequently, with hypoacusis arising or deteriorating in 29 per cent of the patients. Twenty three fractures occurred, including 8 in pagetic bone, with an incidence of respectively 5 and 1.7 per cent patient-years: the risk of fracture did not seem to be increased when etidronate was used at a low dose.

On the day of admission he was in a preshock state, and his pulmonary artery pressure was very high at 90/30 mmHg. Pulmonary blood perfusion scintigraphy showed multiple defects of isotope uptake. Immediately after the scintigraphy, pulmonary embolectomy was performed while using extracorporeal circulation. The operation was successful and his physical activity was markedly improved.

However, it is only effective in some cases and at least 12 weeks is required before efficacy can be ascertained. In an attempt to achieve earlier assessment of response, changes in lymphocyte counts have been studied in patients receiving endocrine therapy. Absolute lymphocytes were not significantly changed by 6 weeks in any patients but there was a significant increase (P less than 0.05) in absolute T counts by 6 weeks in patients who achieved partial remission when compared with those whose disease continued to progress. Percentage T counts increased significantly from pretreatment values (P less than 0.002) in patients in whom disease progression was stopped by endocrine manipulation and this rise was maintained during clinical benefit. Fall in percentage T counts to pretreatment values predated objective evidence of recurrence by as much as 2 months. There was no increase in percentage T counts in patients in whom disease progression continued despite treatment, indicating that the rise in percentage T counts is a secondary phenomenon to tumour response.

In order to avoid inappropriate selectivity and institutional bias, we studied only those cases submitted directly to the Registry of Ophthalmic Pathology in which the enucleated eyes had not been examined initially at the local hospital. Of the 56 eyes removed because of suspected retinoblastoma, 15 (26.8%) did not contain a malignant tumor. In two cases enucleation was delayed because retinoblastoma was not considered initially in the differential diagnosis of spontaneous hyphema. During the same period, two of 268 eyes that were enucleated for reasons other than suspected retinoblastoma were found to contain a retinoblastoma.

Light microscopic examination of bone tissue from 13 patients with Paget's bone disease who were receiving (EHDP) treatment showed considerably reduced osteoclastic resorption accompanied by gradual replacement of irregular woven bone by lamellar tissue. Electron microscopic examination confirmed that pagetoid osteoclasts are morphologically abnormal cells and degenerate after EHDP treatment. EHDP does not affect the measles nucleocapsid-like inclusions in the osteoclast nuclei. Immunocytologic analysis showed that during EHDP treatment viral antigens of the measles type persist in the cytoplasm and nuclei of osteoclasts even when these cells are greatly altered.

The bone age was 1.3 years, and height velocity rose from the 50th to 90th percentile. Plasma concentrations of LH (5.85 mU/ml), FSH (3.29 mU/ml), growth hormone (30 ng/ml), and oestradiol (90 pg/ml) were elevated. The results of a neurological examination including an EEC recording as well as a skull roentgenogram, were unremarkable. The visual evoked potentials were grossly abnormal. A native and contrast CT scan visualized a tumour close to the suprasellar cisterna reaching the chiasma opticum. At the age of 1.2 years the tumours was removed. Histologically the tissue was identified as a hamartoma. Immediately after the operation vaginal bleeding ceased, pubertal development regressed, bone age did not advance any further, the visual evoked potentials normalized and the contrast CT did not show any tumour mass. The levels of LH, FSH, growth hormone and oestradiol 4 months post operation were decreased as follow: LH: 1.14 mU/ml, FSH: 0.70 mU/ml, GH: 15.1 ng/ml, oestradiol: 10 pg/ml.

Experience with 50 cases treated by means of extensive laminectomy, foraminotomy, and excision of osteophytes during the past 10 years.\nAbstract: This paper reviews management by means of the posterior approach of 50 patients with cervical myeloradiculopathy caused by spondylosis and stenosis of the spinal canal seen in the past 10 years. Careful selection of patients is an absolute necessity since a primary cause of failure occurred in individuals who subsequently proved to have motor neurone disease. Older individuals with long-standing neurological deficits, especially long tract signs indicative of fixed lesions, were benefited primarily by a lack of further progression of their disorder and occasional improvement in hand function and gait. Diagnostic evaluation should include electromyography, nerve conduction studies, and sensory evoked cortical potentials. With the introduction of the fourth generation CAT scanning equipment, additional diagnostic information is available regarding the internal configuration of the spinal canal, its contents, and the amount of available space at various levels. Supplementary myelography remains of basic importance. Laminectomy includes two levels above and below the areas of significant canal encroachment. Foraminal decompression with removal of only the innermost third of the foramen permits mobilization of the nerve roots, removal of osteophytes and untethering of the dural sac. A great deal of importance is attached to the preservation of the cervical lordotic curve since, with an adequate decompression and an intact dura, the cord moves dorsally into an expanded canal, rising above the ventrally situated osteophytes. In those patients with reversal of the cervical curve and swan neck deformities, posterior decompression has not been of value. Recent more radical procedures in such cases, such as vertebrectomy, remain to be evaluated. Any procedure which will permit further kyphotic deformity, such as laminectomy, is contraindicated. Eighty-five percent of the patients operated upon by the recommended surgical approach improved.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"cervical spondylotic myeloradiculopathy\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"extensive laminectomy, foraminotomy, and excision of osteophytes\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [\"electromyography,nerve conduction studies,sensory evoked cortical potentials,CAT scanning,myelography\"], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}], "completion": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"cervical spondylotic myeloradiculopathy\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"laminectomy, foraminotomy, and excision of osteophytes\", \"CureRate\": \"0.85\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [\"electromyography,nerve conduction studies,sensory evoked cortical potentials\"], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}\n\n"}

The breast and regional nodes received 45 Gy of 60Co irradiation in 25 fractions over 5 weeks (45 Gy/25/5 wks). Electrons were used to deliver a further 15 Gy/7/1.5 weeks to the internal mammary chain and 25 Gy/11/2.5 weeks to the lower axilla. The primary tumor was boosted by Iridium 192 implant for a further 37 Gy prescribed at 85% of the basal dose rate (Paris system). Rigid needles were secured by templates in single plane (58/398) or double plane (340/398) geometry. Results of the 340 two-plane implants have been analyzed to look for a possible influence of dose rate on local control. Follow-up for patients free of local recurrence is 4-204 months (median: 92 months). The 340 tumors were divided into three groups according to dose rate: 0.32-0.49 Gy/hr (n = 95), 0.50-0.59 Gy/hr (n = 120), and 0.60-0.90 Gy/hr (n = 125). The three groups are statistically comparable according to age, tumor size, mean 60Co dose, mean Iridium dose, overall treatment time, and follow-up. The local failure rate in the three groups is 27% (26/95), 20% (24/120), and 13% (16/125) (p less than 0.03, Chi square). At 15 years the estimated local control (Kaplan Meier) is 60%, 72%, and 84% (p less than 0.02, Logrank), respectively. This analysis indicates that there is a significant effect of dose rate on local control for carcinoma of the breast treated by combined external beam (45 Gy) plus Iridium 192 implantation (37 Gy). To maximize local control the authors recommend an implant dose rate of greater than or equal to 0.6 Gy/hr.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"breast cancer\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"external beam irradiation plus iridium 192 implant\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}], "completion": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"breast cancer\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"radiotherapy\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}\n\n"}

Conventional external pituitary irradiation for acromegaly produces a consistent, but slow, fall in elevated serum growth hormone (GH) levels. It has not been established whether such treatment is effective in preventing the development of cardiovascular complications. The evolution of cardiovascular disease has therefore been studied in 11 acromegalic patients followed up for a mean 10 years (range 3-17) after external pituitary irradiation. At the final follow-up fasting serum GH were significantly (P less than 0.01) lower than pre-irradiation levels, but cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, dysrhythmias, hypertension, major arterial disease, heart failure) increased significantly in prevalence (P less than 0.01) during this period. Electrocardiographic abnormalities also increased in prevalence. At the final follow-up 6 patients had cardiomegaly on chest X-ray and echocardiographs (10 patients) were abnormal in every case. All 11 patients had evidence of complete or partial anterior hypopituitarism. We confirm that external pituitary irradiation is effective in reducing elevated serum GH levels in acromegaly, but suggest that such a slow reduction in serum GH levels does not retard the development of cardiovascular complications.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"acromegaly\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"external pituitary irradiation\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [\"electrocardiographic,chest X-ray,echocardiographs\"], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}], "completion": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"acromegalic\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"pituitary irradiation\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}\n\n"}

Fifty-five knees had only an anterior laxity and 166 anterior laxity combined with medial laxity, in 100 of which tensioning or reinforcement of the medial ligament was needed.

The major complication of this therapy is hemorrhage, with intracranial hemorrhage having the highest morbidity and mortality. Seizures, incisional bleeding and bleeding in the pleural space, hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, renal failure, and cardiovascular complications account for most of the other complications.

About two-thirds of the autotransplants were performed before percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) was established for clinical use. However, vascular disease at a site or type not suitable for PTA was present in 57 (90%) of the kidneys. Hypertension was the leading symptom in 56 patients, including four in whom renal autotransplantation was performed as an emergency for acute renal artery occlusion or malignant hypertension. Blood pressure returned to normal or improved in 51 (91%) and remained unchanged in five patients (9%) following autotransplantation. Three patients with renal artery aneurysm in whom haematuria and loin pain were the indications for treatment, became asymptomatic following surgical intervention. Bilateral renal autotransplantation was performed synchronously in one and sequentially in three patients. There were no operative deaths, but two kidneys were lost postoperatively in two 2-year-old children owing to renal vascular thrombosis. In the follow-up period (mean 4.3 years), one additional kidney was lost at 3 months owing to progressive FMD. Blood pressure and renal function remained stable in all other patients. Based on the excellent results achieved in this series, it is concluded that extracorporeal vascular repair and renal autotransplantation is a safe procedure for the patient as well as the kidney affected by FMD.

The treatment comprised intertrochanteric femoral varus osteotomy in every patient. In 20 patients (25 hips), the course of the disease was more severe than expected. The early radiological criteria for this severe course were: 1. Lateral calcification extending far laterally towards the greater trochanter, 2. Deformation and widening of the femoral head before the fragmentation phase, 3. The Saturn phenomenon; a sclerotic epiphysis surrounded by a ring of looser bony tissue, 4.

Eleven experimental and six control furcations, randomly assigned, are included in this report. The furcations were surgically exposed, using a flap approach and the areas were debrided. On the experimental teeth, Gore-Tex periodontal material was adapted and sutured, using a suspensory suture. The flaps were then sutured tightly, assuring complete coverage to the material. For 1 month all patients were seen weekly and rinsed their mouths with an 0.12% chlorhexidine solution daily. After 4 to 6 weeks the Gore-Tex membranes were removed. Clinical measurements were repeated at 3 and 6 months following surgery. Changes from baseline in PD and CAL were calculated for each case. Results indicated that PD measurements were reduced by both procedures, but the reduction was better for GTR at 3 and 6 months. At six months the test sites showed 2.8 +/- 1.0 mm pocket reduction, while the control sites showed an average of 1.6 +/- 0.9 mm reduction in pocket depth.

They met the following criteria: (1) adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (2) completion of treatment before age 20, (3) a minimum follow-up of five years thereafter, (4) a minimum age of 22 years at final follow-up, and (5) operation performed by the senior author. Of these, 95 were personally examined. The surgical technique from 1968 to 1973 included a two-stage Harrington distraction, with fusion added at the second operation (52 patients). From 1973 to 1975, 48 patients were treated with a one-stage distraction and fusion after a week of preoperative Cotrel traction. Postoperatively, all patients were treated with a Milwaukee brace. A spinal examination and functional assessment, including a questionnaire and pain drawing, full standing anterior-posterior (AP), and lateral roentgenograms of the spine, was performed by independent observers. Eighty-five subjects without scoliosis served as a control group. The radiographic evaluation showed the usual nearly 50% permanent correction at the follow-up examination averaging nine years postoperatively. Lateral roentgenograms, however, demonstrated in 52% flattened or kyphotic cervical spines producing no significant complaints, non-significant flattening of the thoracic kyphosis, but significant lowering of the lumbar lordosis. Fifteen of the 24 patients with distal hook insertion and fusion including L4 or L5 demonstrated retrolisthesis. All had significant low-back pain. Degenerative facet joint changes and disc space narrowing was noted in 11 patients, again with a distal hook purchase in L4 or L5. Compared to the controls, the operated patients, as a group, revealed no lessened activity or back pain at any location.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"adolescent idiopathic scoliosis\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"Harrington rod fusion\", \"CureRate\": \"0.5\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [\"spinal examination,full st,ing anterior-posterior (AP),,lateral roentgenograms of the spine\"], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}], "completion": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"adolescent idiopathic scoliosis\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"Harrington rod fusion\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}\n\n"}

Epileptic seizures occurred in the left extremities and recurred several tens of times daily despite intensive pharmacological treatment. EEG investigations demonstrated seizure activity in the right motor-parietal-temporal area. Stereotaxic destruction of Forel's field and thalamus on the right side gave only brief improvement lasting several days. In view of this the frontal, temporal and a part of the parietal lobe were removed according to electrocorticographic investigations. During 6 months after the operation epileptic attacks were absent, than they recurred with increasing frequency. After 10 months full hemispherectomy was done. The child tolerated the operation very well, and control examination after 2 years showed disappearance of epileptic attacks and considerable compensation of motor power loss and sensory disturbances in the left extremities. The authors believe that hemispherectomy carried out in two stages at an interval of several months is better tolerated by the patients and makes possible better compensation of functional disturbances than classic hemispherectomy.

The authors report here five cases. Three patients were initially with a cardiovascular collapse and all had an acute renal failure. Sodium bicarbonate haemodialysis therapy led to a dramatic improvement. Consciousness and hemodynamic status recovered rapidly. Severe metabolic and blood gases derangements were also rapidly corrected. Plasma metformin removal, appreciated by repeated blood samplings in 3 cases, was satisfactory. All patients survived. However, blood metformin levels remained abnormally high at the end of the dialytic therapy. In conclusion, (1) bicarbonate dialysis is an adequate treatment of lactic acidosis observed in diabetic patients treated with metformin since it rapidly corrects the acid-base disorders and partially removes metformin; (2) the sole accumulation of metformin is not sufficient to explain lactic acidosis since this latter might be corrected in spite of persisting high levels of blood metformin.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"lactic acidosis\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"hemodialysis\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}], "completion": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"lactic acidosis\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"sodium bicarbonate haemodialysis\", \"CureRate\": \"1.0\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"metformin therapy\"}]}\n\n"}

The treatment consisted artificial ventilation, fluid and electrolyte infusions and a six hour hemodialysis (HD) on days 2, 3 and 4. The convulsions disappeared on day 4; the patient regained consciousness on day l2 and recovered with slight sequelae. Toxicokinetic studies were conducted for a period of 12 days. The lithium (Li) serum concentration fell from 4.4 mmol/l on admission to 2.16 before HD and 0.35 after three HD. Li serum half life was 54 hours before HD, 25 hours during the three days on which HD was carried out and 106 hours thereafter. The Li cerebrospinal fluid/Li serum ratio ranged between 0.4 and 0.6 and was not influenced by HD. Mean renal clearance was 10.6 ml per min. During hemodialysis, Li serum half life decreased to 3.5 - 4.9 hours and clearance was 108 ml/min. A total amount of l28.6 mmol lithium was excreted; 84.3 mmol by HD and 44.3 mmol in urine.

The prognostic significance of beta 2-microglobulin changes in patients with terminal chronic kidney failure treated by repeated hemodialysis.\nAbstract: In patients with chronic renal insufficiency (CRI) treated by programmed haemodialysis (HD) were detected, during the last years, amyloid stores at the level of carpal tunnel, of some joints, bones etc., finding which permitted to describe a new type of amyloid, the so-called \"dialysis associated amyloid\". The immunochemical structure of this amyloid is similar to that of the beta-2-microglobulin (beta-2m). Patients display various clinical manifestations. The variations of serum and urinary beta-2m were studied in 51 uraemic patients chronically dialyzed by means of dialyzers with cuprophan membrane, the average duration of the HD treatment being of 51.5 months. The pre- and postdialysis values of the beta-2-m were determined by Mancini radial immunodiffusion. A considerable increase--about 25 times--of serum beta-2-m was observed, which was more marked in anuric patients and those with a duration of more than 5 years of HD treatment. Among these, 15.7% show various articular manifestations (detected clinically and radiologically): a carpal tunnel syndrome (one patient required surgery) and arthropathies with various sites (scapulohumeral, knee). During a HD sitting with cuprophan membrane dialyzers, an increase of beta-Z-m was recorded, but it was statistically non-significant.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"chronic renal insufficiency\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"hemodialysis\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}], "completion": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"amyloidosis\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"chronic hemodialysis\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}\n\n"}

Nine patients (36%) underwent repeated surgery in order to ensure adequate successful vascular access for haemodialysis, whilst only 14.1% of patients suffering from renal insifficiency of another cause had to undergo operation on more than one occasion in order to be treated.

In this group, 3/4 of the patients needed several operations in order to make dialysis possible. Fourteen patients underwent bilateral nephrectomy. One death occurred in a patient who had received a renal transplant during the same operation.

The diagnosis of tuberous sclerosis was ascertained by the association of typical cutaneous retinal and osseous lesions. On the contrary, the renal localisations were unusual. Early hypertension was exacerbated in the course of 2 pregnancies but was never severe. It preceded the late onset of renal failure which progressed slowly. The kidneys were small, with a peculiar angiographic aspect: the renal tissue was not invaded by hamartomas but the whole arterial bed was diffusely modified, with a cortical perfusion defect. Both kidneys were studied after bilateral nephrectomy. The lesions were far more complex than a simple replacement of the renal tissue by angiomyolipomas: they involved the vessels, the interstitium (with lipids inclusions surrounded by a macrophagic reaction) and the glomeruli (with focal and segmental sclerosis).

In 10 adult patients with severe type II hyperlipoproteinemia, a single HELP treatment of 3 1 plasma led to an acute decrease in the average plasma viscosity (PV) from 1.30 to 1.1 mPas. At the same time, an even more marked decrease in the mean erythrocyte aggregation rate from a pathological value of 7.9% to a value of 3.7% (normal range less than 5%) was observed. Long-term studies on five patients demonstrated a lasting improvement in these two haemorheological variables. The acute rheological changes were also accompanied by an improvement in polarographically determined muscle oxygen tension. Mean oxygen tension values measured in both the m.biceps brachii and the m.tibialis anterior in five patients before and after a single HELP treatment increased from 30 +/- 4 to 37 +/- 7 mmHg and from 27 +/- 2 to 31 +/- 3 mmHg respectively.

Six of the 29 Type D fractures failed to unite radiologically following surgery. Incorrect screw placement was a factor in two cases. The average time from injury to surgery in three of the others was seven years. Radiological evidence of screw loosening was present within two months of mobilising these cases.

The primary intraocular tumor, a metastatic mass at recurrence, and the tumor cells infiltrating bone marrow were all positive for the anti-GD2 monoclonal antibody (Mab) 3A7. Indirect immunofluorescence using the monoclonal antibody 3A7 was an effective method of detecting residual disease in the marrow. After remission was achieved by conventional therapy, the patient underwent autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT). The preparative regimen consisted of VP-16, cisplatinum, high-dose melphalan, and total body irradiation. The autologous marrow inoculum was clean of tumor cells at the detection level of 1:10,000.

Ten of them were treated prospectively with a radiation-chemotherapy protocol. All but four specimens were recently reexamined and classified according to the Working Formulation system. The predominant histologic types were diffuse large cell type, large cell immunoblastic type, and diffuse mixed small and large cell type, seen in 38%, 21%, and 21% of cases, respectively. Before 1980, 16 patients were treated with postoperative radiation without definite chemotherapy, and only one has survived more than 5 years. Local recurrence was the most common cause of failure. In 1981, the authors started a protocol in which four to six courses of systemic chemotherapy with vincristine, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and prednisolone (VEPA) was given after whole brain radiation (30-40 Gy) with a local boost up to 50 to 60 Gy. Eight patients completed this protocol, and all of them are alive at 16 to 100 months after diagnosis, with three patients surviving more than 5 years. Only one patient developed recurrence. On the other hand, six patients who did not complete or receive chemotherapy after 1981 are dead or alive with recurrence. Correlation between the Working Formulation subtype and prognosis was not clear because of the variety of treatment. Two patients receiving chemotherapy developed brain necrosis, which was fatal in one case, and the other two patients treated with the protocol are in a poor state without signs of recurrence. Chemotherapy may enhance the radiation effect on normal brain tissue as well as tumor. Combination of radiotherapy and chemotherapy can improve the survival rate, but the optimal dosage needs to be investigated further.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"primary intracranial lymphoma\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"high dose radiation and systemic vincristine-doxorubicin-cyclophosphamide-prednisolone chemotherapy\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}], "completion": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"primary intracranial lymphoma\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"high-dose radiation and systemic vincristine-doxorubicin-cyclophosphamide-prednisolone chemotherapy\", \"CureRate\": \"1.0\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}\n\n"}

A culture study in vitro revealed that retinol, which is the main metabolite of retinol palmitate detected in plasma, induced morphological and functional maturation of leukemic promyelocytes. These findings may indicate that retinol palmitate induces cell differentiation and slows proliferation of leukemic cells in vivo, and that the reduction in cell growth is the key phenomenon in the clearing of leukemic cells, rather than the maturation phenomenon itself.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"acute promyelocytic leukemia\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"retinol palmitate\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}], "completion": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"acute promyelocytic leukemia\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"retinol palmitate\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}\n\n"}

One patient died after operation from myocardial infarction; and one patient went abroad. The healing course of the remaining 97 fractures is described, classified according to the type of fracture and the accuracy of operative reduction. Seventy-five fractures had a normal time to union, defined as the lasting achievement of full weight-bearing within 4 months. In 7 fractures the healing period was moderately delayed (full weight-bearing being achieved in 4-6 months) and in 5 it was seriously delayed, requiring 6-11 months after injury. Nonunion occurred in 4 cases and refracture in 6 cases. Osteitis developed in 2 cases and was successfully treated with antibiotics within 6 weeks. A second internal fixation was necessary in 12 patients. In 5 patients a plaster cast was applied to treat delayed union. Amputation was necessary in a 75-year-old man with senile dementia who developed infection after a second operation for refracture. One patient still has a pseudarthrosis after 2 years and 2 further operations. In the other 95 fractures union was the end-result. Of the 21 comminuted and open fractures only 13 healed within 4 months. We recommend a different approach in the treatment of badly comminuted and open 'high-energy' fractures. With this reservation, we find that the method of rigid internal fixation which we employ has given satisfactory early results.

The most important parameters for evaluation of the results were the Wiberg CE angle, the acetabular angle, the minimum joint space, and the horizontal component of the resultant force. Clinically and radiographically there was an 80% success rate according to Severin's method of evaluation. There was also good correlation with the computerized analysis.

Following sigmoid colectomy and descending colostomy, a catheter was inserted from the right gastroepiploic artery to the proper hepatic artery. From the day of surgery 5-Fluorouracil was administered in doses of 250 mg/day continuously through a catheter over the 2-month period of hospitalization. After the patient was discharged, 250 mg/day of 5-Fluorouracil was administered at home using Vaxter Infusor according to a regimen of 10-day continuous infusion and subsequent 4-day rest. Five months after the initial operation, the serum CEA level decreased dramatically, and CT scan of the liver revealed the complete disappearance of the metastases. The patient underwent a second operation in which the colostomy was closed, and she is doing well at this writing.

In Japan it has long been common knowledge that the ingestion of green tea should be avoided before and after the intake of iron preparations. There have recently been some reports, however, that deny the effect of green tea on iron preparations. A study was conducted on pregnant patients with anemia, using sodium ferrous citrate (Ferromia). The drug was administered to a group of patients taking green tea and a group taking water. Our results can be summarized as follows. 1. Hemoglobin, serum iron and total iron binding capacity were markedly improved after the administration of the iron preparation, and there was no difference between these parameters in the two groups of patients. 2. There was a tendency for patients with hypochromia to show a more marked improvement in hemoglobin in both groups. 3. Anemia cured in 96.7% of patients in the green tea group and in 93.4% of patients in the water group after the oral administration of the iron preparation. 4. The incidence of side effects stood at 18.3% for the green tea group and 21.9% for the water group, there being no significant difference.

The most common late postoperative sequelae were inverted areolae and hypaesthesiae of the areolar region. When operation was carried out, half of the patients were overweight. The remainder were of normal weight. Among the patients, who were overweight time of operation, 2/3 found that the cosmetic correction was unsatisfactory. In the \"normal weight group\" 2/3 were satisfied with the cosmetic result. The patients in the dissatisfied group found that too little tissue had been removed from the area. The operation is carried out through a little infraareolar incision. Because of this, it is technically difficult, especially in patients with considerable subcutaneous tissue.

Hemiballism is generally associated with lesions in the subthalamic nucleus. However, hemiballism occasionally occurs as a result of lesions outside the subthalamic nucleus. Hemiballism is a benign condition with spontaneous recovery in most cases, but hemiballism caused by lesions outside the subthalamic nucleus is reported to tend to persist for a long term. In our case without involvement of the subthalamic nucleus, hemiballism so far continued for three months since the onset. Successful pharmacological treatments of ballism with haloperidol or phenothiazines were well known. In our case, the treatments of ballism with these drugs were unsuccessful due to drug-induced hepatic dysfunction. Instead of these drugs, ballism was improved by administration of 150 mg of sulpiride per day with no side effects.

Case report.\nAbstract: The authors report a case in which an enlarging skull fracture was surgically repaired on the fourth day after the initial injury. A 5-month-old boy fell from his father's arms and was hospitalized with a large, irregular protrusion in the left parieto-occipital region and right hemiparesis. Plain skull films showed a diastatic linear fracture with a maximum width of 8 mm, which expanded to 11 mm by the fourth day. Computed tomography (CT) scans revealed a cerebral contusion just beneath the fracture as well as a left subdural effusion. At operation, the contused brain tissue was found to have herniated over the bone defect. Craniotomy revealed a large dural defect, which was repaired with lyophilized dura. The patient was discharged with no neurological deficit. On the basis of a review of 58 recently reported cases of skull fracture, the authors conclude that the following conditions warrant consideration of early surgery: 1) a diastatic skull fracture with a width of at least 4 mm; 2) CT demonstration of a cerebral contusion beneath the fracture; 3) overlying scalp swelling; and 4) a neurological abnormality contralateral to the fracture. Performing surgery before the fracture gap becomes scalloped will result in more rapid neurological recovery and reduce the likelihood of enlargement of the fracture.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"skull fracture\", \"Symptoms\": [\"irregular protrusion in the left parieto-occipital region\", \"right hemiparesis\"], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"surgery\", \"CureRate\": \"1.0\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [\"computed tomography (CT)\"], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}], "completion": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"skull fracture\", \"Symptoms\": [\"left hemiplegia\"], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"craniotomy\", \"CureRate\": \"1.0\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [\"plain skull films,computed tomography (CT)\"], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}\n\n"}

Comprehensive analyses of blood and urinary steroids showed that although the steroid profiles differed between patients, the pattern in each patient remained almost constant as the disease progressed, or remitted due to therapy. Elevations of serum testosterone and oestradiol were commensurate with the extent of virilisation, and the urinary output of aldosterone was associated with the severity of hypertension. A new finding was that all had substantially increased urinary free deoxycorticosterone. Complete surgical removal of the primary tumours was impossible but when most of the tumour tissue was removed, full clinical and biochemical remissions were obtained for a short time in 2 patients. One patient obtained a clinical and biochemical remission from op'DDD. In another patient the drug caused reduction both in blood pressure and in urinary aldosterone excretion, but there were unpleasant side effects. A third patient could not tolerate op'DDD. Metyrapone therapy produced neither clinical nor biochemical improvement in 3 patients. The mean duration of survival was 17 months after the first symptoms and 10 months from the date of operation. Despite advances in drug therapy, adrenal cortical carcinoma remains a lethal disease. Biochemical screening of multiple steroids offers a means of early diagnosis and disease monitoring.

Analysis of 40 patients treated by the same surgeon.\nAbstract: Forty patients with acute ruptures of the Achilles tendon were treated surgically by the same physician (T.B.Q.) during a period of 1947 to 1971. The average followup was 19 years. Ninety percent of the patients were men (average age 37.5 years) who were engaged in recreational sport activities. The majority denied a physical conditioning program. The acute ruptures were treated by a surgical procedure which consisted of a 15-cm incision on the medial aspect of the tendon with either the plantaris muscle being woven through the Achilles tendon in a clockwise fashion or a pull-out wire, supplemented with silk mattress sutures, being used to repair the ruptured tendon. The wound was closed and the patient's leg was immobilized. The wire was removed at 6 weeks. The rehabilitation plan consisted of ambulation with a heel lift and elastic stocking (the height of the lift was gradually reduced) and toe exercises. The patients began walking downstairs backwards at 3 months and continued exercises until full range of motion was attained. Subjectively, the results were excellent as graded by the patients. Objectively, there were some minor deficits but they did not impede the overall function. On a scale of 1 (poor) to 4 (excellent), the clinical results were rated excellent (42%), good (36%), fair (15%), and poor (6%).

A simple gross excision of the tumor provides the best cosmetic result, but a wide local resection may be important to prevent local recurrence in some patients. In order to identify patients who are not adequately treated by gross excision of the tumor and radiation therapy, we performed a retrospective clinical-pathologic review of 221 treated women with infiltrating duct carcinoma. There were 53 cases in which the excision specimen showed a constellation of three pathologic features: prominent intraductal carcinoma in the tumor, intraductal carcinoma in the grossly-normal adjacent tissue, and poorly-differentiated nuclei. These cases had a 37% risk of a local recurrence at 6 years compared to eight per cent for all other cases (p less than 0.0001). In cases with all three features, the use of a supplemental dose of radiation to the primary site did not significantly reduce the risk of a local recurrence. Local recurrence at 6 years was 34% in cases with all three features, who received supplemental local radiation, compared to 49% in cases not receiving a supplemental dose (p = 0.28). Survival was also worse for patients with all three features compared to other cases (69% vs. 90% at 6 years, p = 0.002). These results indicate that patients with all three pathologic features have a high risk of local recurrence following gross excision of the tumor and radiation therapy. If primary radiation therapy is selected for these patients, they should first undergo a re-excision of the tumor site in order to be certain that areas of extensive intraductal carcinoma have been adequately resected. Patients whose tumors do not show all three features are adequately treated by gross excision of the tumor prior to radiation therapy.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"breast cancer\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"surgical resection\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}], "completion": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"breast cancer\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"radiotherapy\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}\n\n"}

Of the 150 patients, 103 suffered from pleomorphic rhabdomyosarcomas, 40 patients had embryonal rhabdomyosarcomas, and 7 had alveolar cell type of rhabdomyosarcoma. The males suffered almost twice as much as the females from this form of cancer (96 males to 54 females). The fifth decade had the highest incidence of all rhabdomyosarcomas. The younger patients generally suffered from embryonal rhabdomyosarcomas and the older ones from pleomorphic rhabdomyosarcomas, although age was no barrier to the occurrence of embryonal rhabdomyosarcomas in some of the older patients and pleomorphic rhabdomyosarcomas in some of the younger patients. Caucasians were almost exclusively afflicted by this form of cancer (93% of this series). The lower extremity was the most frequent site of the lesion, occurring in 50.7% of the 150 cases. The upper extremity was the second most frequently involved site (28%), and the trunk was the least involved site (21.3%). Of the 150 patients studied, 40 were considered indeterminate. Thirteen patients are alive and free of cancer, but were treated less than 5 years ago; 12 patients reported for consultation only. There were 13 who were free of sarcomas at periods in excess of 2 years but were lost to follow-up. Two patients in this series died before the 5-year period, and autopsy revealed the death to be due to causes other than the rhabdomyosarcoma. Of the 110 determinate patients, 75 (68%) died as a result of the cancer. The 5-year survival rate equals 32%. The fact of the 30% 5-year survival after treatment for recurrences should help dismiss the pessimism which prevails once a recurrence is noted subsequent to major therapy. Age per se had no great effect on prognosis. The poorest results occurred in the 11-20 age range, with a 5-year survival of 15%. This value reflects on increased incidence of embryonal rhabdomyosarcomas which tend to be more malignant and metastasize earlier than do the pleomorphic type. The effect of location upon survival revealed that of 76 patients with involvement of the lower extremity, 34% survived 5 years or longer, and those with sarcomas of the trunk had the poorest survival (26%). The fact that the trunk, by virtue of its anatomy, limits the degree of surgery that can be perfomred, probably helps to explain this difference. The role of radiation therapy and chemotherapy awaits elucidation. Reports of combined surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy are encouraging.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"rhabdomyosarcoma of the extremities and trunk\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"surgical resection\", \"CureRate\": \"0.32\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}], "completion": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"rhabdomyosarcoma of the extremities and trunk\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"resection\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}\n\n"}

A histological examination of the abdominal tumor indicated proliferation of undifferentiated lymphoblasts with intermingled histiocytes so called \"starry sky appearance\". The diagnosis was Burkitt's lymphoma. On the 4th post-operative day, a cardiac tamponade became evident. The pericardial effusion contained many lymphoblasts and the diagnosis was pericarditis due to the invasion of lymphoma cells. The pericarditis was successfully treated by infusion of doxycycline into the pericardial space following drainage. The patient responded to systemic chemotherapy with complete remission. 7 courses of systemic chemotherapy along with intrathecal infusions for CNS prophylaxis were subsequently carried out. A state of complete remission has continued for more than 13 months. Cardiac tamponade accompanied by Burkitt's lymphoma is quite rare and has not ever been reported in Japan in our knowledge.

She had discovered the tumor two years previously, but had never visited any medical institution. She was diagnosed as advanced breast cancer with multiple lung metastases, bone metastasis, and both supraclavicular lymph node metastases by physical examination, fine needle aspiration cytology, chest X-P, and bone scintigraphy. Incisional biopsy, performed to confirm the histological type of breast cancer and to evaluate estrogen and progesterone receptor (ER and PgR) status, revealed solid-tubular carcinoma. Both ER and PgR were highly positive at 322.6 and 228.0 fmol/mg protein, respectively. Therefore, endocrine therapy was chosen to treat this advanced breast cancer patient, although she had multiple organ metastases. Twenty mg of Tamoxifen a day was administered per os. After treatment with tamoxifen, the size of ulceration started to decreased and the dyspnea caused by multiple lung metastases was reduced. Eight weeks after, she showed partial response (PR) determined from the size of the ulceration and chest X-P. She has been maintaining PR for more than 9 months.

Aortography revealed fusiform, calcified aneurysm of the infrarenal abdominal aorta and severe stenosis of right common iliac artery. CT scan demonstrated a soft tissue density structure around the aortic aneurysm which was enhanced after contrast medium injection. At surgery, the aneurysm had a thick, firm, smooth wall which was shiny white in appearance and adherent perianeurysmal fibrosis was marked. In order to avoid injury to surrounding tissue such as the duodenum or vena cava, thrombo-exclusion method was chosen.

The present study verifies the value of negative predischarge exercise testing in identifying low-risk patients treated with thrombolysis after AMI. One hundred fifty-seven consecutive patients with an uncomplicated clinical course underwent maximal or symptom-limited exercise testing (Bruce treadmill protocol) within 15 days of AMI in the absence of therapy. The location of the AMI was anterior in 51 patients, inferior in 85 and non-Q-wave in 21. All of the patients were followed for 6 months. Death and nonfatal reinfarction were considered as major coronary events, and the recurrence of angina as a minor event. Exercise test results were negative in 105 patients (group 1) and positive for angina or ST depression greater than or equal to 0.1 mV in 52 (group 2). No deaths occurred during follow-up; there were 3 reinfarctions (3%) and 7 cases (7%) of postinfarction angina in group 1, and 2 reinfarctions (4%) and 21 cases (40%) of postinfarction angina in group 2. By the end of follow-up, 90% of the patients with negative exercise test results were event-free (97% in the case of major events).

DIP demonstrated an irregular right lateral wall of the urinary bladder. CT of the pelvic cavity revealed a protrusive mass lesion inside the urinary bladder. Cystoscopy proved a circular, edematous and irregular mass lesion around the urinary bladder neck. The pathological examination of TUR specimens showed a proliferative chronic cystitis. However, after about half a year, there was a recurrence of mass lesions in the urinary bladder. Moreover, right non-functional kidney and left hydronephrosis were observed. For preserving renal function, total cystoprostatectomy was performed. Nerve sparing technique for sexual function, and total bladder replacement using a detubularized sigmoid colon to obviate the need for a stoma were adopted.

The authors describe a patient with optic nerve infiltration by acute promyelocytic leukemia documented ophthalmoscopically and confirmed by standardized echography and magnetic resonance imaging. High-resolution chromosome banding revealed the patient had a 15;17 chromosomal translocation known to be associated with acute promyelocytic leukemia. Treatment was instituted with oral all trans-retinoic acid without adjuvant radiotherapy or intrathecal chemotherapy. Results of serial bone marrow examination showed progressive differentiation of malignant cells with complete bone marrow remission. Results of serial ophthalmic examinations showed complete resolution of the leukemic optic nerve head infiltration. All trans-retinoic acid alone can be an effective treatment for optic nerve head infiltration in acute promyelocytic leukemia.

Excessively elevated plasma ACTH concentrations and radiological evidence of sella turcica deformation led to the diagnosis of ACTH-producing adenomas and prompted their removal by transsphenoidal microsurgery. In one patient, a large Crooke's cell adenoma with extensive extrasellar expansion had caused severe and irreversible bilateral defects of the visual fields and unilateral optic atrophy. Surgical removal of the tumour and radiotherapy brought about a permanent disappearance of the hyperpigmentation, but eventually led to secondary hypothyroidism. In the second patients, the selective removal of a small intrasellar eosinophilic adenoma consisting of ACTH-producing cells did not alleviate the hyperpigmentation and did not lower the plasma ACTH concentration. However, hyperpigmentation regressed markedly within a year of treatment with a higher dose of cortisone. The rarity of similar cases in the literature seems to indicate that insufficient feedback suppression of ACTH-producing cells in treated Addison's disease does not by itself induce the development of a pituitary adenoma, but might promote the growth of an independently and coincidentally occurring microadenoma, which would have caused Cushing's disease in a person with intact adrenal glands.\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"addison's disease\", \"Symptoms\": [\"progressive hyperpigmentation\", \"bilateral defects of the visual fields\", \"unilateral optic atrophy\", \"secondary hypothyroidism\"], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"transsphenoidal microsurgery\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [\"plasma ACTH concentrations,radiological evidence of sella turcica deformation\"], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}], "completion": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"addison's disease\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"transsphenoidal microsurgery\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}\n\n"}

Trilostane afforded reduction of plasma levels of aldosterone, progesterone, deoxycorticosterone, 17-OH progesterone, cortisol, delta 4-androstenedione, and urinary excretion of 17-hydroxycorticosteroid. Conversely, circulating levels of dehydroepiandrosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, and urinary excretion of 17-ketosteroids were increased following this drug therapy. Suppression of mineralo- or glucocorticoid biosynthesis was accompanied by an increase in plasma renin activity.

He had been diagnosed as having ventricular septal defect (VSD) at the age of 6 years. When he was hospitalized, he was in a condition of class IV by NYHA classification, with a white blood cell count of 17,300/mm3, an increase in CRP, a red blood cell sedimentation rate of 108 mm/hr, and positive alpha-streptococcus in blood culture. His cardiothoracic ratio was 64% with signs of pulmonary congestion on a chest X-ray film. Echocardiography revealed the presence of VSD and huge vegetations on the tricuspid, mitral and aortic valves. He was considered to have active infective endocarditis (AIE) which had presumably been provoked by VSD and the tooth removal. Penicillin G at a daily dose of 20 million units and gentamicin at a daily dose of 80 mg were intravenously administered to treat the alpha-streptococcus infection for about 4 weeks. Furosemide was used for congestive heart failure. Since, although his cardiac function appeared to have been improved, the signs and symptoms of the infection persisted, triple valve replacement for the tricuspid, mitral and aortic valves and patch closure of the VSD were performed 4 weeks after the hospitalization. The operation revealed inflammatory lesions extending from the endocardium of the right ventricle to the mitral valves through the VSD, and huge vegetations on the tricuspid, mitral and aortic valves. The operation was successful and the inflammatory areas gradually disappeared.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\nPlease extract disease and treatment-related information from the above text, return the result as JSON data, and strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema. schema:{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"\", \"Symptoms\": [], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"\", \"CureRate\": \"\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"ventricular septal defect associated with active infective endocarditis\", \"Symptoms\": [\"breathlessness\", \"continuous fever\"], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"triple valve replacement, ventricular septal defect patch closure\", \"CureRate\": \"1.0\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [\"white blood cell count,CRP,red blood cell sedimentation rate,chest X-ray film,echocardiography\"], \"Causes\": \"ventricular septal defect (VSD)\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"ventricular septal defect diagnosed at 6 years old\"}]}"}], "completion": "{\"Sample\": [{\"Diseases\": \"ventricular septal defect\", \"Symptoms\": [\"breathlessness\", \"continuous fever\"], \"TherapeuticsInformation\": [{\"TherapeuticsApproach\": \"triple valve replacement and ventricular septal defect patch closure\", \"CureRate\": \"1.0\", \"DrugFrequency\": \"\"}], \"DiagnosisMethods\": [\"periodontal tooth removal\"], \"Causes\": \"\", \"MedicalHistory\": \"\"}]}\n\n"}

In a series of 15 consecutive patients with large cerebellopontine angle tumors, all of which were more than 2.5 cm in diameter, tumor excision was performed by a one-stage combined middle fossa-translabyrinthine approach. There were 13 acoustic neuromas, 10 of which were more than 4 cm in diameter, one petrous apex meningioma 4 cm in diameter, and one facial neuroma 3 cm in diameter. The tumors were totally removed in all 15 patients. The facial nerve was preserved in 12 of 13 evaluable patients. In the 14th patient the nerve had been transected in a previous suboccipital procedure with incomplete removal, and in the 15th patient the nerve was sutured following excision of a facial neuroma. Thus, the nerve was lost at surgery in only one patient. This combined approach provided very clear visualization of the cerebellopontine angle, including the brain stem and the lower cranial nerves. It enabled identification of both the origin of the facial nerve at the brain stem and the lateral segment of the nerve in the internal auditory canal. Anterior extensions of tumor growing through the tentorial hiatus were easily removed. The results in these 15 patients show that this approach is excellent for total removal of large acoustic neuromas with preservation of the facial nerve.

Three of the 27 patients (11%) who were asymptomatic at the outset continued to have symptoms. The nature of the CSH was well-defined in 25 patients; 19 of the 20 cases of cardio-inhibitory CSH and 4 of the 5 cases of mixed CSH were asymptomatic. These two poor clinical results were analysed: the patient with the cardio-inhibitory CSH (one recurrence in 84 months) had a drop of 40 mmHg in systolic blood pressure which fulfilled criteria of the cardio-inhibitory form of CSH (a drop of 30 to 50 mmHg). The second case was a complete therapeutic failure with 3 recurrent syncopal episodes. The patient had a mixed form of CSH (B.P. drop of 65 mmHg) associated with a \"pace maker syndrome\" (drop of 50 mmHg in systolic blood pressure at the onset of VVI pacing without any sino carotid massage).
